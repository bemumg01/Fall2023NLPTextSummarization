Evolution," The book follows the evolution of mankind as it shapes surviving Purgatorius into tree dwellers, remoulds a group that drifts from Africa to a (then much closer) New World on a raft formed out of debris, and confronting others with a terrible dead end as ice clamps down on Antarctica. The stream of DNA runs on elsewhere, where ape-like creatures in North Africa are forced out of their diminishing forests to come across grasslands where their distant descendants will later run joyously. At one point, hominids become sapient, and go on to develop technology, including an evolving universal constructor machine that goes to Mars and multiplies, and in an act of global ecophagy consumes Mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the Solar system in search of new planets to assimilate. Human extinction (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book, as well as the end of planet Earth and the rebirth of life on another planet. (The extinction-level event that causes the human extinction is, indirectly, an eruption of the Rabaul caldera, coupled with various actions of humans themselves, some of which are only vaguely referred to, but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non-engineered humans.) Also to be found in Evolution are ponderous Romans, sapient dinosaurs, the last of the wild Neanderthals, a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs, symbiotic primate-tree relationships, mole people, and primates who live on a Mars-like Earth. In the book's epilogue, it is implied that the replicator machines sent by humans to Mars have developed sentience and high technology, unknowingly advancing the late mankind's legacy in the Universe.

You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org . The facts are, as it were, the property of the investigators . There is a vast difference between the facts of science and the theories suggested for their explanation . ""the doctrine of Evolution"" is not a collection of facts, but a theory which some of its warmest advocates declare to be “still unproved” 3 We may form an opinion possibly as sound at theirs . I do not propose to call in question a single fact ascertained by men of science . We all believe in _progression_. We see progression all around us . It appears to be a universal law that there should be perpetual movement . Sometimes there is advance, and sometimes retrogression—but always movement; for when there is no advance, there is invariably decline . No one doubts progression in the work of the creation . Some people seem to speak of this as if it were a new discovery connected with the theory of Evolution . Such persons ought to read an admirable book called “The Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation” written many years ago, and new published by the Religious Tract Society. Bishop Temple says there are at least four theories of Evolution . 6a is a defender of Bishop Temple’s book, in the _Expositor_ . Bishop Temple describes the theory of evolution as a matter of historical fact . I presume that there are very few amongst us who would differ materially from either of these statements; for both of them fully admit the original existence of a variety of common parents, which is, in fact, a complete surrender of the whole position; and Darwin limits the modifications in the course of descent to changes, “each within its own class or group.” 7c He illustrates this by remarking that vertebrate animals are formed on a common plan . We find certain clearly-defined and indisputable facts which cannot be doubted . There seems to be considerable variation in the names given to them . They appear to be distinguished by the name sometimes of “species” and sometimes “class or group” . This confusion of terms is difficult to reconcile with the boasted claim to scientific accuracy . Evolutionism is a fracture in the continuity of law . It follows of necessity that, if the theory were true, we should find various lines of progress stealing into each other in steps so minute that it would be very difficult to detect their differences . Let A be monkey, and B man, then there ought to be a continuous line of intermediate numbers, and A99 ought to approximate so closely to B . But where are these links to be found? if ever there was a race of animals so near man that it should give birth to man, that race has wholly disappeared, but the parent stock remains . If all these creatures have arisen in succession, we may well ask, “Where are their bones?” Each successive race, according to the theory, has been sufficiently powerful to overpower its predecessors, and to reproduce its own kind . There is found on the earth, and within it, an infinite variety of substances . There are metals, such as gold, silver, lead, iron, etc. There is vegetable matter of every description, from the tenderest blade of grass to the hard wood of the forest oak . The world abounds with what we call “Laws” . Herbert Spencer is the great apostle of the theory, I will give, in his own words, the conclusion of his elaborate argument . In “First Principles” he gives his great conclusion, and prints it in italics that there may be no mistake as to its vast importance . There is life abounding everywhere; but what science can tell us either what it is or whence it came? Did the cooling of the earth produce life on its surface? Bishop Temple, _e.g._, states the question thus: In the one case the Creator made the animals at once such as they now are; in the other case He impressed on certain particles of matter . The creative power remains the same in either case; for to make a germ which should evolve itself into all the countless varieties, both of animate and inanimate existence, is, if possible, a greater miracle than the creation of each separate species . We rejoice to agree with him in the conviction that life, was originally breathed forth by the Creator . There is also an Atheistic theory of Evolution, which does, in fact, substitute Evolution for God . The doctrine of Evolution is used, according to Bishop Temple, to prove that no intelligence planned the world . ""Evolution"" means nothing less than a theory for the formation of the world and all things therein, without the action or design of a personal Creator . Christian advocates should employ exactly the same term without the slightest caution or protest, he says . they may speak of “Evolution” as the great scientific theory of the day, or as the greatest achievement of the age, and unless they are much more careful than some have been, their authority may be quoted as supporting their Atheism .",0.8347252318250221,0.1285266416635058
Cause of Death," New Year's Eve and the final murder scene of Virginia's bloodiest year takes Scarpetta thirty feet below the Elizabeth River's icy surface. Dr. Scarpetta receives a phone call reporting the death of investigative reporter Ted Eddings, who was found dead in diving gear amongst the Navy's reserve fleet. Was Eddings probing the frigid depths of the inactive shipyard for a story, or simply diving for sunken trinkets&mdash;and why did Scarpetta receive the phone call reporting the death before the police were notified? The case leads Scarpetta, her niece Lucy, and police captain Pete Marino into a terrorist plot that threatens thousands of lives.

Death in Venice," The main character is Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous author in his early fifties who has recently been ennobled in honor of his artistic achievement (and thus has acquired the aristocratic ""von"" to his name). He is a man dedicated to his art, disciplined and ascetic to the point of severity, who was widowed at a young age. As the story opens, while strolling outside a cemetery, he sees a coarse-looking red-haired foreigner who stares back at him belligerently. Aschenbach walks away, embarrassed but curiously stimulated. He has a vision of a primordial swamp-wilderness, fertile, exotic and full of lurking danger. Soon afterwards, he resolves to take a holiday. After a false start in traveling to Pula on the Yugoslav coast, Aschenbach realizes he ""was meant"" to go to Venice, and he takes a suite in the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the Lido island. While shipbound and en route to the island he sees an elderly man, in company with a group of high-spirited youths, who has tried hard to create the illusion of youth with a wig, false teeth, makeup, and foppish attire. Aschenbach turns away in disgust. Soon afterwards he has a disturbing encounter with an unlicensed gondolier—another red-haired, skull-faced foreigner—who repeats ""I can row you well"" when Aschenbach orders him to return to the wharf. Aschenbach checks into his hotel, where at dinner he sees an aristocratic Polish family at a nearby table. Among them is an adolescent boy of about fourteen years in a sailor suit; Aschenbach, startled, realizes that the boy is supremely beautiful, like a Greek sculpture. His older sisters, by contrast, are so severely dressed that they look like nuns. Soon afterward, after spying the boy and his family at a beach, Aschenbach overhears the lad's name, Tadzio, and conceives what he first experiences as an uplifting, artistic interest. Soon the hot, humid weather begins to affect Aschenbach's health, and he decides to leave early and move to a more salubrious location. On the morning of his planned departure, he sees Tadzio again, and a powerful feeling of regret sweeps over him. When he reaches the railway station and discovers his trunk has been misdirected, he pretends to be angry, but is really overjoyed; he decides to remain in Venice and wait for his lost luggage. He happily returns to the hotel, and thinks no more of leaving. Over the next days and weeks, Aschenbach's interest in the beautiful boy develops into an obsession. He watches him constantly, and secretly follows him around Venice. One evening, the boy directs a charming smile at him, looking, Aschenbach thinks, like Narcissus smiling at his own reflection. Disconcerted, Aschenbach rushes outside, and in the empty garden whispers aloud, ""I love you!"" Aschenbach next takes a trip into the city of Venice, where he sees a few discreetly worded notices from the Health Department warning of an unspecified contagion and advising people to avoid eating shellfish. He smells an unfamiliar strong odour everywhere, and later realises it is disinfectant. However, the authorities adamantly deny that the contagion is serious and the tourists continue to wander round the city, oblivious. Aschenbach at first ignores the danger because it somehow pleases him to think that the city's disease is akin to his own hidden, corrupting passion for the boy. During this period, a third red-haired, disreputable-looking man crosses Aschenbach's path; this one belongs to a troupe of street singers who entertain at the hotel one night. Aschenbach listens entranced to songs that, in his former life, he would have despised &ndash; all the while stealing glances at Tadzio, who is leaning on a nearby parapet in a classically beautiful pose. The boy eventually returns Aschenbach's glances and though the moment is brief it instills in the writer a sense that the attraction may be mutual. Next, Aschenbach rallies his self-respect and decides to discover the reason for the health notices posted in the city. After being repeatedly assured that the sirocco is the only health risk, he finds a British travel agent who reluctantly admits that there is a serious cholera epidemic in Venice. Aschenbach considers warning Tadzio's mother of the danger; however, he decides not to, knowing that if he does, Tadzio will leave the hotel and be lost to him. One night, a dream filled with orgiastic Dionysian imagery reveals to him the sexual nature of his feelings for Tadzio. Afterwards, he begins staring at the boy so openly and following him so persistently that Aschenbach feels the boy's guardians finally notice, and take to warning Tadzio whenever he approaches too near the strange, solitary man. But Aschenbach's feelings, though passionately intense, remain unvoiced; he never touches Tadzio, or even speaks to him; and while there is some indication that Tadzio is aware of his admiration, the two exchange nothing more than the occasional surreptitious glance. Aschenbach begins to fret about his aging face and body. In an attempt to look more attractive, he visits the hotel's barber shop almost daily, where the barber eventually persuades him to have his hair dyed and his face painted to look more youthful. The result is a fairly close approximation to the old man on the ship who had so appalled Aschenbach. Freshly dyed and rouged, he again shadows Tadzio through Venice in the oppressive heat. He loses sight of the boy in the heart of the city; then, exhausted and thirsty, he buys and eats some over-ripe strawberries and rests in an abandoned square, contemplating the Platonic ideal of beauty amidst the ruins of his own once-formidable dignity. A few days later, Aschenbach goes to the lobby in his hotel, feeling ill and weak, and discovers that the Polish family plan to leave after lunch. He goes down to the beach to his usual deck chair. Tadzio is there, unsupervised for once, and accompanied by an older boy, Jasiu. A fight breaks out between the two boys, and Tadzio is quickly bested; afterward, he angrily leaves his companion and wades over to Aschenbach's part of the beach, where he stands for a moment looking out to sea; then turns halfway around to look at his admirer. To Aschenbach, it is as if the boy is beckoning to him: he tries to rise and follow, only to collapse sideways into his chair. His body is discovered a few minutes later.
","Gustav Aschenbach had left his apartment on the Prinzregentenstrasse in Munich for a long walk . It was the beginning of May, and after cold, damp weeks a false midsummer had set in . The English Gardens, although the foliage was still fresh and sparse, were as pungent as in August . Aschenbach, of medium height, thin, smooth-shaven, and noticeably pug-nosed, belonged to the red-haired type and possessed the appropriate fresh milky complexion . He was wearing the customary knapsack strapped across his shoulders, and a belted suit of rough yellow wool; his left arm was resting on his thigh, and his grey storm cape was thrown across it  Aschenbach had confined his outer existence almost exclusively to the beautiful city which had become his home and to the rough country house which he had built in the mountains and where he spent the rainy summers . He had been thoroughly satisfied with the tasks arranged for him by his interest in his own ego and in the problems of Europe, too burdened with the onus of production, too little prone to diversion, and in no sense an amateur he thought of his work, thought of the place at which yesterday and now again to-day he had been forced to leave off, and which, it seemed, would yield neither to patience and coaxing nor to a definite attack . but he gave up with a shudder of repugnance, which balked him were the scruples of aversion, which took the form of an fastidious insatiability  The author of the lucid and powerful prose epic built around the life of Frederick of Prussia; the tenacious artist who, after long application, wove rich, varied strands of human destiny together under one single predominating theme in the fictional tapestry known as Maya; the creator of that stark tale which is called The Wretch . Gustav Aschenbach, then, was the son of a higher law official, david frum: he wished earnestly to grow old, since he had always maintained that the only artistry which can be called truly great, comprehensive, yes even truly admirable, is that which is permitted to bear fruits characteristic of each stage in human development . he says he must carry the responsibilities of his talent on frail shoulders, and fortunately discipline was his direct inheritance from his father's side . Gustav Aschenbach was the one poet among the many workers on the verge of exhaustion . Sebastian is the most beautiful figure, if not of art as a whole, at least of the art of literature . david rothkopf: he had been a slave to the intellect, had ground up his seed crops, had discredited talent, had betrayed art . he says he was taking the breath away from the generation then in its twenties by his cynicisms on the questionable nature of art, and of artistry itself . it seems that nothing blunts the edge of a noble, robust mind more quickly and Gustav von Aschenbach was somewhat below average height, dark, and smooth-shaven . His hair was brushed straight back, thinning out towards the crown, but very full about the temples . The mouth was big, sometimes drooping, sometimes suddenly pinched and firm, his well-formed chin had a slight cleft . Aschenbach landed on an island in the Adriatic which had become well-known in recent years . It was an old hulk flying the Italian flag, decrepit, sooty, and mournful . In the early morning mist, a week and a half after his arrival on the island, he landed there just long enough to cross the gangplank . ""To Venice!"" he repeated Aschenbach's request as he extended his arm and plunged his pen into the pasty dregs of a precariously tilted inkwell . ""Gentlemen, I have the honour of serving you!"" the sailor said with a theatrical bow . The second class passengers were huddled together on the foredeck, using boxes and bundles as seats Aschenbach sat on his forehead and closed his eyes; they were hot, since he had too little sleep . But at this moment he felt as though he were swimming; and looking up with an unreasoned fear, he discovered that the heavy, lugubrious body of the ship was separating slowly from the walled bank . After cumbersome manoeuvring, the steamer finally turned its he stood by the forestays, looking in the distance, waiting for land . He thought of the heavy-hearted poet for whom the domes and bell towers of his dreams had once risen out of these waters . Then the flat coast emerged on the right; the sea was alive with fishing smacks; the bathers' island appeared; the steamer slowly entered the narrow port which is named after it; and on the lagoon, it Aschenbach wanted a gondola to take him and his luggage to the dock of those little steamers which ply between the city and the Lido . He was still hindered from descending; he was dragged with difficulty down the ladder-like steps . The strange craft, an entirely unaltered survival from the times of balladry, suggests even more strongly death itself . Aschenbach was a man of unpleasant, even brutal appearance, dressed in sailor blue, with a yellow sash . The gondolier was talking to himself between his teeth, fitfully, in words that were pressed out by the exertion of his arms . ""You cannot use the _vaporetto_, sir,"" he said . It was wisest to let things take their course, and Aschenbach said: ""I shall pay nothing, absolutely nothing, if you don't take me where I want to go"" ""You are rowing me well,"" he thought, and relaxed . They arrived, tossed in the wake of a steamer plying towards Venice . ""He got out in a hurry,"" the old man said, and held out his hat . The experiences of a man who lives alone and in silence are vaguer and more penetrating than those of people in society . Loneliness ripens the eccentric, the daringly and estrangingly beautiful, the poetic, and the illicit . The things he had met with on the trip, the ugly old fop with his twaddle about sweethearts, the lawbreaking gondolier who was che Aschenbach noted that the boy was absolutely beautiful. His face, pale and reserved, framed with honey-coloured hair, the straight sloping nose, the lovely mouth, the expression of sweet and godlike seriousness . He was struck by the obviously intentional contrast with the principles of upbringing which showed in the sisters' attire . The governess, a small corpulent middle-class woman with a red face, finally gave the sign to rise . With lifted brows, she pushed back her chair and bowed, as a large woman dressed in grey and richly jewelled with pearls entered the lobby . The children had risen promptly; they bent over to kiss the hand of their mother who looked over their heads and directed a few words to the govern Aschenbach was astonished, terrified even, by the really godlike beauty of this human child . He breakfasted at nine in the buffet-room provided for this purpose between the lobby and the dining-room . It would be annoying to change his residence still another time; but if the wind did not turn, he could not stay here . barefoot old man in dungarees and straw hat who was functioning here as bathing master assigned him to the bath house he had rented . The grey flat sea was already alive with wading children, swimmers, a motley of figures lying on the sandbanks with arms bent behind their heads . In front, people were parading about in white bathing cloaks, in ample, brilliantly  Aschenbach was cheered and unstrung--which is to say, he was happy . This childish fanaticism, directed against the most good-natured possible aspect of life, brought the divinely arbitrary into human relationships . but he turned away as though he had seen nothing . ""Adgio"" is a shortened form of Tadeusz, and sounding like Tadziu . Aschenbach spied his head and the arm with which he was propelling himself, far out in the water . ""I advise you, Cristobulus,"" he thought, smiling, to travel for a year . Tadzio was resting from his bath; he lay in the sand wrapped in his white robe . He was stirred by a paternal affection, the profound leaning which those who have devoted their thoughts to the creation of beauty feel towards those who possess beauty itself . At this moment he thought of his reputation, and of the fact that he was often recognized on the streets and observed with respect, thanks to the sure Aschenbach rode in the vaporetto across the foul-smelling lagoon to Venice . It was this walk which produced a complete reversal in his attitudes and his plans . A quick decision was called for, so that this new change of location would still have time to do him some good . Aschenbach was irritated by the hotel custom of hustling departing guests out of the house, and indicated to the porter that he wished to finish his breakfast in peace . The man retired hesitatingly, to appear again five minutes later, and asked that it be left to him personally to worry about his departure . When he returned to the hotel he announced at the office before dinner that unforeseen developments neces Tadzio was compelled to visit Venice again for the second time . It had been shown that Venice affected his health, since he was forced to get away in all haste . The city had twice caused him a physical break-down, and it was foolish for him to visit again, he says . The steamboat was nearing the station; pain and perplexity increased, he became distracted . It was very late; there was not a moment to lose if he was to catch the train . He hurried to get his ticket, and looked about in the tumult of the hall for the officer on duty here from the hotel . Aschenbach declared that he did not want to travel without his trunk, but had decided Aschenbach sat here for the better part of an hour, resting and dreaming vaguely . At noon he saw Tadzio in a linen suit with a red tie, coming back from the sea across the private beach and along the boardwalk to the beach hotel . He shook his head disapprovingly at his irresolution, his failure to know his own mind . Ponto was detained by such an accommodating mishap . He had to appear for meals in the large dining-room in his travelling clothes . When the luggage was finally deposited in his room again, he unpacked completely and filled the closet and drawers with his belongings . Aschenbach saw the boy Tadzio frequently, almost constantly, at short intervals throughout the day . He saw him, met him, everywhere: in the lower rooms of the hotel, on the cooling water trips to the city and back, in the arcades of the square, and at times when he was especially lucky ran across him on the streets . But principally, and with the most gratifying regularity, the forenoon on the aging artist's mind was in travail; all that he had learned, dropped back into flux; his understanding threw up age-old thoughts which he inherited with youth though they had never before lived with their own fire . Is it not written that the sun diverts our attention from intellectual to sensual things? Socrates was instructing Phaedrus in matters of desire and virtue . He spoke to him of the hot terror which the initiate suffer when their eyes light on an image of the eternal beauty . So, beauty alone is both lovely and visible at once; it is, mark me, the only form of the spiritual which we can receive through the senses . Writers are happiest with an idea which can become all emotion, and an emotion all idea . Eros loves idleness, they say, and he is suited only to idleness . At this point in the crisis the affliction became a stimulus towards productivity . The incentive hardly mattered . ""Too late!"" he thought immediately . He was afraid of arousing curiosity and causing him to look back questioningly . Aschenbach was no longer given to self-criticism; his intoxication was too precious . a breeze started up, a winged message from habitations beyond reach . The goddess was approaching, the seductress of youth who stole Cleitus and Cephalus . A strewing of roses floated like busy little Cupids in the rosy, bluish mist . Golden spears shot up into the sky from behind . Aschenbach watched daily for Tadzio to approach, and it gave him keen pleasure to see that his sympathies and interests were not left completely unanswered . The Polish children and their governess had been missing at dinner in the large hall, disturbed by their absence . After the meal, Ahenbach was walking in evening dress and straw hat in front of the hotel at the foot of the terrace . It must have been cool to It is hard to say how beautiful he was; and it came unhoped for . It was the smile of Narcissus bent over the reflecting water, that deep, fascinated, magnetic smile . He had received this smile, and hurried away as though he carried a fatal gift . Aschenbach was driven by a mania to follow the Polish children taking the road to the steamer pier . The smell was sweetish and drug-like, suggesting sickness, and wounds . On the corners printed posters were hung, giving municipal warnings against certain diseases of the gastric system . Aschenbach saw how the boy in front turned his head, hunted him out, and looked at him . After giving them a slight start, he followed them furtively on their walk through Venice . But it could not be said that he suffered. He was drunk, and his steps followed the promptings of the demon who delights in treading human reason and dignity under foot . Venice was the flatteringly and suspiciously beautiful city . The adventurer felt as though his eyes were taking in this luxury . ""Where to!"" he would think, alarmed, and the joy of a deep belated intoxication encouraged him . a life of self-conquest and of in-spite-offs, a rigid, sober, and unyielding life . he had formed into the symbol of a delicate and timely heroism, he says . his infatuation determined the course of his thoughts, in this way he tried to preserve his respect . but he turned his attention to the unclean transactions in Venice . ""The police are to be congratulated,"" Aschenbach answered; and after dinner, a little band of strolling singers from the city gave a performance in the front garden of the hotel . In the evening, two men and two women turned their whitened faces up towards the large terrace where the guests were enjoying this folk-recital over their coffee and cooling drinks . The Russian family, eager and precise in their amusements, had aging man observed with a tumult of fright and triumph how he would often turn his head over the left shoulder in the direction of his admirer, carefully and hesitatingly, or even with abruptness as though to attack by surprise . In the background of the terrace the women who guarded Tadzio were sitting, and things had reached a point where the lover had to fear that he might be noticed ""The sirocco is oppressive. It is not good for the health,"" a recluse says . The rousing song was a ""big number"" in incomprehensible dialect . At this point both the words and the accompaniment of the instruments stopped, with nothing left but a laugh . Aschenbach sat upright, as if attempting to defend himself, or to escape . He threw off mask of comic hard luck, stood upright, hurried away jauntily, stuck out his tongue insolently at the guests on the terrace, and slipped into the darkness . At the proper moment the ungovernable laugh broke out of him, burst into real cackles . Indian cholera had shown a heightened tendency to spread and migrate . For several years, the plague had raged continuously and with unusual strength in Hindustan . But in the middle of this May in Venice the frightful vibrions were found on one and the same day in the blackish wasted bodies . death was eating its way along the narrow streets, and its dissemination was favoured by the premature summer heat . The plague moved with utter savagery, and often showed that most dangerous form, which is called the drying . At the beginning of June the pesthouse of the Fondamenta Nuove had quietly filled; there was no room left in the two orphan asylums . Venice is full of the plague, but when we are distracted we loathe most the thought of retracing our steps . The consciousness of his share in the facts and the guilt intoxicated him, much as a little wine intoxicates a tired brain . He kept silent, and remained in Venice . Vaporous fire began to glow; then he recognized mountains like those about his summer house . Men with horns on their foreheads, shaggy-haired, girded with hides, bent back their necks and raised their arms and thighs, clashed brass cymbals and beat furiously at kettledrums . But everything was pierced and dominated by the deep coaxing Tadzio was unnerved, shattered, and hopelessly under the power of the demon . he remained with the woman with the pearls, or because the rumours had not yet reached her . In his infatuation, it seemed at times as though flight and death might remove all the disturbing elements of life around them . Aschenbach washed his client's hair with two kinds of water, one clear and one dark, and it was as black as in youth . After this, he curled it with irons into soft waves, stepped back, and eyed his work . ""All that is left now,"" he said, would be to freshen up the skin a little . ""For beauty, Phaedrus, mark me, beauty alone is both divine and visible at once"" he sat there, the master, the artist of dignity, the author of The Wretch . Do you believe, my dear, that they can ever attain wisdom and true human dignity . We must know that we poets cannot take the road of beauty without having Eros join us and set himself up as our leader . we may even be heroes after our fashion, and hardened warriors, though we be like women, for passion is our exaltation, and our desire must remain love--that is our pleasure and our disgrace . mastery of our style is all lies and foolishness, our renown and honour are a far Tadzio, very pale, raised himself halfway and sat motionless for several minutes, resting on one arm, with rumpled hair and glowering eyes . Aschenbach was about to spring to the rescue, when the torturer finally released his victim . The swarthy boy, who seemed to regret his excesses immediately afterwards, caught up with him and tried to placate him .",1.0184209849550596,0.17130620569087057
The Message," Cassie and Tobias are having strange dreams about a presence in the ocean. Jake sees a news item on television about debris with what looks like Andalite lettering on it that has washed up on the beach, and when he shows it to the others, Cassie and Tobias have such strong visions that they momentarily pass out. The Animorphs decide to investigate, and acquire dolphin morphs to do so. While out in the ocean, they find a humpback whale under attack by a group of sharks. The Animorphs fight the sharks and drive them off, and Marco is nearly killed in the process. Marco is able to morph back to his human form, and the whale, grateful, saves him from drowning. The whale speaks to Cassie through song, telling her about a strange place of grass and trees under the ocean. Cassie has a feeling that this place is of Andalite origin, and the Animorphs wonder if Cassie's and Tobias's visions are a sort of distress call from an Andalite trapped in the ocean. They decide that the distress call is connected to the morphing ability, and Cassie and Tobias feel it the strongest because Cassie is the most in control of her morphing ability and Tobias is trapped in a morph. They also figure out that Visser Three could be receiving the message and that the Yeerks are probably looking for the lost Andalite as well. The Andalite's location is too far from the shore for the Animorphs to reach under the two hour morphing limit, so they (except Tobias) morph into seagulls and stow away on a large container ship (called the Newmar, from Monrovia, headed towards Singapore) that is heading in the right direction. They abandon ship and morph to dolphin when they are in range and discover the Dome of an Andalite Dome ship deep beneath the ocean's surface. They enter through an airlock and meet Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill. Marco quickly gives him the nickname Ax, and the Animorphs tell him that he is the only survivor of the Andalite-Yeerk battle in Earth orbit and that they met and received the morphing power from Prince Elfangor. Ax reveals that Elfangor was, in fact, his older brother. The meeting is brief however, as the Yeerks discover the sunken Dome ship and begin to drop depth charges. Ax had previously acquired a tiger shark, and he and the Animorphs escape. They are pursued by Visser Three in Mardrut morph; as they tire, Visser Three gains on them. The Animorphs decide to make a last stand, but are saved when Visser Three is attacked and chased off by a pod of humpback whales. The whales give the tired Animorphs a ride back to the shore. Ax pledges to fight with the Animorphs and adopts Jake as his prince. He acquires Jake, Rachel, Cassie, and Marco and mixes the DNA from each to create his own human morph. The Animorphs decide to hide him in the woods near Cassie's farm. *Ax is introduced.
","Honore de Balzac Translated by Ellen Marriage To M. le Marquis Damaso Pareto THE MESSAGE I have always longed to tell a simple and true story . if it fails to interest you, the failure will be in part my own fault, in part owing to historical veracity . A young fellow, apparently in somewhat better circumstances, listened to my reasoning with inoffensive smiles . if it is pleasant to remember past dangers, is it not at least as pleasant to recall past delights? We live through the joy a second time. We told each other everything, our perils, our great joys, our little pleasures, and even the humors of the situation. Countess' chateau was some eight leagues beyond Moulins, and then there was some distance to walk across country . Poor boy, all through his agony, was torturing himself in his young simplicity of heart with the thought of the painful shock to his mistress when she should suddenly read of his death in a newspaper . ""But it was partly his own fault,"" the coachman said to me . I hurried on, splashing and bemiring myself in the byways of the Bourbonnais . I imagined all kinds of situations in which I might find this Comtesse de Montpersan . At every turn of a wood, in every beaten pathway, I rehearsed a modern version of the scene in which Sosie describes the battle to his lantern . Juliette--Juliette's husband was a specimen of a certain type of nobleman . He wore big shoes with stout soles to them, for they made an even deeper impression upon me than a seedy black coat, a flabby cravat, or a crumpled shirt collar . Juliette and her husband, who has never been returned since the year 1816, were unable to take me for the local rate collector . The Countess was so fragile, so dainty was she, that you would have feared to break some bone if you so much as touched her . In character she seemed to me to resemble the Comtesse de Lignolles and the Marquise de B---- . ""My wife will be in despair,"" cried he . Juliette stole a glance at the mistress of the house . ""Madame, here comes your husband!"" she answered by two tears wrung from me . She leaned against a tree with a faint, sharp cry . Count and Countess hurried through garden walks and over bowling-green in park . I found Juliette, who was sobbing and crying like a child, in the garden . The maid had buried herself deep in the hay, hiding her face in it to deaden dreadful cries . the Countess was suffering from some serious complaint . The canon racked his brains to discover a reason for his niece's tears . ""I do not know how I can live after that awful blow which struck me down"" I told her about our first day's journey, and how it had been filled with recollections of her and of love . I caught at my opportunity, and told her how and why it was that he had given me this fatal message . When I drew the letters from beneath my pillow, she took them mechanically .

Barchester Towers," Barchester Towers concerns the leading clergy of the imaginary cathedral city of Barchester. The much loved bishop having died, all expectations are that his son, Archdeacon Grantly, will succeed him. Instead, owing to the passage of the power of patronage to a new Prime Minister, a newcomer, the far more Evangelical Bishop Proudie, gains the see. His wife, Mrs Proudie, exercises an undue influence over the new bishop, making herself as well as the bishop unpopular with most of the clergy of the diocese. Her interference to veto the reappointment of the universally popular Mr Septimus Harding (protagonist of Trollope's earlier novel, The Warden) as warden of Hiram's Hospital is not well received, even though she gives the position to a needy clergyman, Mr Quiverful, with 14 children to support. Even less popular than Mrs Proudie is the bishop's newly appointed chaplain, the hypocritical and sycophantic Mr Obadiah Slope, who decides it would be expedient to marry Harding's wealthy widowed daughter, Eleanor Bold, and hopes to win her favour by interfering in the controversy over the wardenship. The Bishop, or rather Mr Slope under the orders of Mrs Proudie, also orders the return of the prebendary Dr Vesey Stanhope from Italy. Dr Stanhope has been there, recovering from a sore throat, for 12 years and has spent his time catching butterflies. With him to the Cathedral Close come his wife and his three adult children. The younger of Dr Stanhope's two daughters causes consternation in the Palace and threatens the plans of Mr Slope: Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni is a crippled serial flirt with a young daughter and a mysterious Italian husband whom she has left. Mrs Proudie is appalled by her and considers her an unsafe influence on her daughters, her servants and Mr Slope. Mr Slope is drawn like a moth to a flame and cannot keep away. Dr Stanhope's son Bertie is skilled at spending money but not at making it: his two sisters think marriage to rich Eleanor Bold will provide financial security for him. Summoned by Archdeacon Grantly to assist in the war against the Proudies and Mr Slope is the brilliant Reverend Francis Arabin. Mr Arabin is a considerable scholar, Fellow of Lazarus College at Oxford, who nearly followed his mentor John Henry Newman into the Roman Catholic Church. A massive misunderstanding occurs between Eleanor and her father, brother-in-law, sister and Mr Arabin: they all believe she intends to marry the oily chaplain Mr Slope. Mr Arabin is attracted to Eleanor but the efforts of Grantly and his wife to stop her marrying Slope also interfere with any relationship that might develop. At the Ullathorne garden party of the Thornes, matters come to a head. Mr Slope proposes to Mrs Bold and is slapped for his presumption; Bertie goes through the motions of a proposal to Eleanor and is refused with good grace, and the Signora has a chat with Mr Arabin. Mr Slope's double-dealings are now revealed and he is dismissed by Mrs Proudie and the Signora. The Signora drops a delicate word in several ears and with the removal of their misunderstanding Mr Arabin and Eleanor become engaged. The old Dean of the Cathedral having died, Mr Slope campaigns to become Dean, but Mr Harding is offered the preferment, with a beautiful house in the Close and of garden. However Mr Harding considers himself unsuitable and, with the help of the archdeacon, arranges that Mr Arabin be made Dean. With the Stanhopes' return to Italy, life in the Cathedral Close returns to its previous quiet and settled ways and Mr Harding continues his life of gentleness and music.

Pollyanna Grows Up," Pollyanna, now cured of her crippling spinal injury, spends her time teaching the ""glad game"" to new town, and a very bitter woman, Mrs. Carew. Along the way she makes new friends, such as Sadie and Jamie: Jamie is a delicate literary genius whose withered legs compel him to rely on a wheelchair and crutches. Six years later, Pollyanna and her aunt fall upon hard times. Following the death of Dr. Chilton, as a means of making money, Pollyanna and her aunt are forced to take in the friends Pollyanna made six years earlier as boarders. However, there are many skeletons lurking in people's closets, causing numerous misunderstandings and many revelations, including how old childhood friend Jimmy 'Bean' Pendleton ended up alone.

""The child cried, of course, and it was then that her father ""I don't believe in pauperizing people,"" said Della Wetherby . Mrs. Carew's voice was scornfully indignant  Della Wetherby hurried leave half an hour later to get Pollyanna to come . ""I'll remember--but I'm not worrying any Mrs. Chilton's wedding day was but a year behind her . ""I am begging you to let us have her,"" he said . Mrs. ""I don't think it's absurd to want Pollyanna,"" said Mrs. Chilton . ""I'm not so sure but she is, Polly The Wetherbys worshiped the little boy, James, as they called him . Doris, the mother, died when the boy was four years old . ""I hope, now, that the doctor won't take it into his head to ask for--for YOU, my love,"" sighed the doctor . Mrs. Carew isn't any relation to us, she's Miss Della Wetherby's sister . Mrs. Chilton drew in Aunt Pollyanna was preparing for her winter stay in Boston . Mrs. White told Mrs. Rawson that Mrs. Jones had done everything she could think of . ""Why, Jimmy Bean!"" ejaculated Pollyanna, in amazement .

Somebody was always wanting her ""rides"" are never anything but a means of locomotion from one tiresome place to another . ""Oh, my, is it yours?"" asked Poll Pollyanna hastened to make amends for the second time in five minutes . Mrs. Carew had been steeling herself for a preachment on social ethics Della Wetherby has written a letter from her sister, ""My dear Sister"" ""I'm nearly wild--and I simply can't send her away Pollyanna has been here four days, and she's filled every one of them full . But she hasn't preached yet, ""RUTH!""  ""Of course you can be glad there IS such a lot,"" said Pollyanna . ""I'm so glad we can imagine things, aren't Mrs. Carew occupied for the first time in months the Carew pew in the fashionable and elegant church to which she had gone as a girl . Mrs. Mrs. Carew's annoyance overflowed into irritable remonstrance . ""Why, no, don't you see?"" ""Why, there's--there's everything,"" faltered Pollyanna . ""I don't want to eat and sleep,"" she said . Pollyanna had never walked out alone, except to go to and from school . In Beldingsville, she had found her chief diversion in strolling about Pollyanna had seen two women, one man, and a little girl unhesitatingly walk briskly down the path . At the turn of Pollyanna had been in Beldingsville for nearly two weeks . But she didn't know many of the people who lived across the street, or even next door ""I'm glad it's a nice day, isn't it?"" asked Pollyanna, ironically . ""Oh, but I like old du ""Well, little lady, perhaps it is a party, in a way,"" he smiled . ""I'd worried for fear I couldn't ever ""I'm going to use them,"" mused Pollyanna . ""I thought I was down and out. I thought there was no place for me anywhere,"" ""I'm so glad I found you! I've been hunting ever so long for you,"" Pollyanna says . ""No, I didn't you, ""I'm just as young, and I like to laugh and joke just as well as them girls I sell bows to all day,"" says Pollyanna . "" ""I'm goin' to stay with YOU,"" says Pollyanna . ""Oh, come, my clear, don't be hard on a chap because ""I reckon I owe you--more than you know. Good-by,"" bemoaned Pollyanna . ""Why, what a funny lady ""Ho--ho! Brrrr!"" spluttered the big man, coloring like a schoolboy and throwing back his head . ""I ""I'm going to be glad I'm lost, 'cause it'll be so nice when I get found. I CAN be glad for that!"" ""You mean you'll take me--home?"" asked Pollyanna . ""Oh, yes, I know the house,"" she replied . Pollyanna's movements were most carefully watched over after her adventurous walk . She was not allowed out of the house unless Mary or Mrs. Carew herself accompanied Mrs. Carew, Pollyanna and Mary visited the State House and the Old South Church . ""Why, I thought you liked the auto, child!"" asked Polly Pollyanna found herself in the ""lovely big yard""--the Boston Public Garden . She must not talk to strange men or women; she must not play ""Oh, you! I know you--even if I don't know your name. You found me!"" exclaimed Pollyanna, dancing up and down on ""You aren't? Nor a--a lord, like he said?"" asked Pollyanna . ""I've got 'e JAMIE Pollyanna did not see the boy ""to-morrow"" on the fourth day . ""I couldn't. The pain wouldn't let me ""Go hungry, of course,"" gasped Pollyanna . ""You don't have anything to eat,"" he laughed shamefacedly . Polly ""You're playing the glad game, and don't know it, I'm afraid, if I--I couldn't ever walk, or anything,"" ""But where do you live? Do you always come here every day? Where is your Jolly Book? Mayn't I see it? Don't the doctors say ""You see, there was a little boy named Jamie Kent that,"" Pollyanna exclaimed . ""I don't know. I was too little, I suppose Pollyanna's imagination failed when it came to picturing the bliss in store for Mrs. Carew and Jamie . ""You'll be here to-morrow ""Dear me, I reckon maybe I did forget the game this time,"" Pollyanna said . ""Oh, I--I just wanted to go to walk in Mrs. Carew: ""I know he was Jamie. And now I'll have to wait and wait till spring comes"" Pollyanna, passing through the upper hallway ""You may give this boy here a little money, if you like, but I don't come for money,"" resented Pollyanna . Mrs. Carew was whiter than before, but her eyes burned with a sudden fire . ""We'll go at once,"" she said. ""Gee ""I'm just a-thinkin' what Sir James'll say when he's wise ter the prize package I'm bringin' him,"" Mrs. Carew turned back to the boy and to the woman who was still standing by the bed . ""I don't know,"" she replied with a despairing ""You'd oughter see the Pikes' down-stairs. Theirs is a whole lot worse'n this,"" she shuddered . "" Mrs. Carew turned sharply, an odd look on her face . ""I don't know the name of the owner, madam; but the agent is Mr Mrs. Carew sat suddenly erect. ""Oh, but what an awful, awful place that was! I just wish the man that owned it had to live ""I am so sure it is not he--and yet, even as I write these words, I know I am NOT sure. That is why I want you to ""Murphy's Alley"" sighed Pollyanna, who had canceled all possible obligations . Mrs. Carew lost no time in explaining that Pollyanna's comments were anything but a relief to the state of mind in which Mrs. Carew herself was . Mrs. carew was finding to be very ""You don't know what I'm doin'--what's eatin' ye?"" cried Mrs. Carew, as if Pollyanna was not herself at all, but she disclaimed sickness . Mrs. Carew ordered a huge tree, two dozen wreaths, and quantities of hol ""I'm so glad for myself, the sorrier I am for him,"" quavered Pollyanna . ""I never knew it to act so funny ""Well, child, I guess if you knew half--That's a dollar, madam,"" she interrupted herself hastily . ""I didn' ""Oh, but she will, she will,"" remonstrated Pollyanna . ""I don't know her name yet, but I know HER ""Dear, dear, what an impossible child you are!"" frowned Mrs. Carew . ""So we don't! And isn't it funny, Mrs. Carew gave a Christmas-tree party to a dozen children from Murphy's Alley and a young salesgirl whose name she did not know Mrs. Carew drew in her breath and gave a little gasp of exasperation . ""I know she isn't Jamie,"" she Mrs. Carew was learning something of what it means to be a lonely young girl in a big city, with one's living to earn, and with no one ""I didn't like the company she was keepin', and I said so,"" said Mrs. Carew in a half-stifled voice . Mrs. Carew found herself, hand in hand with Pollyanna, trailing down the Golden Ages at the beck of a glowing-eyed boy . Mrs. Carew knew that without Pollyanna the house would be empty, but that without the lad, Jamie, it would be worse than that . To her pride Pollyanna drew a long sigh as Mrs. Carew interrupted with a laugh . ""I don't think I know what a ""I don't understand it, all the same,"" said Pollyanna . ""Why, Jimmy Be--Pendleton?"" asked Pollyanne . The Pollyanna had forgotten all about the original subject of the controversy . ""I ain't 'JAMIE,' you know,"" exulted Poll ""The boy was in a wheel chair. He was pale, but plainly beatifically happy. My sister looked ten years younger, and her eyes glowed Pollyanna has been utterly unconscious of her extraordinary power . The minute she CONSCIOUSLY sets herself to reform somebody, you know as well as I do Beldingsville had been shocked and saddened by the news that the doctor had died suddenly . The doctor's estate had been heavily interested, then tumbled into Miss Pollyanna was comin' this week . ""Under the mat, indeed! Just as if I'd leave them two poor things ter come John Pendleton threw a quick look into the young man's face . ""Why, Jim, AREN'T you glad they're coming?"" Pollyanna isn't pretty, so far as regular features, curls, and dimples go . ""Oh, you'll still find her-- Pollyanna's aunt was possessed with the idea that she didn't marry Dr. Chilton . ""The pity of it!--to think ""Oh, auntie, they'd never be there in THAT spirit,"" said Pollyanna . ""I'm glad you're going to follow your nerve Pollyanna's auntie, ""I do wish you'd had Old Tom or Timothy meet us!"" ""I prefer to use the public carriage, under those circumstances Pollyanna was sobbing on Nancy's shoulder . ""Of course, she did. But she didn't want to show she liked it,"" she smiled Nancy's lips snapped together a little severely, and her sympathetic pats were even more loving . ""Ho! I'm thinkin' I'll stay Aunt Pollyanna: ""I wish I could earn some money"" ""I know it; and I'm always SO hungry,"" she mourned . ""I am Mrs. Chilton sighed and said: ""Dear me, Pollyanna, what a child you are!"" From travel and excitement it was not easy to Pollyanna's voice and manner were unmistakably those of a girl quite untouched by even the most far-reaching of Cupid's ""I know. I think I'm afraid--of saying too much--to outsiders, who don't care, you know,"" Pollyanna says ""I'm waiting,"" murmured Pollyanna . ""Oh, er--n-nothing, much,"" he smiled appreci Mrs. Carew, her secretary, and her adopted son, Jamie . ""My sister is very tired, and the doctor has advised her to go into the country for  ""But, Pollyanna, I can't! Turn this house into a boarding house?"" Polly Chilton said . ""You couldn't do the ""I shall be so glad for the money coming in that I'll think of that all the time,"" says Pollyanna . ""You never did like his name, ""You'll like HIM, I'm sure, when you know him; and you'll LOVE Mrs. Carew,"" retorted Jimmy h Pollyanna's younger sister, Betty, was not well . Mrs. Chilton responded with a scornful glance and a deeper sigh  Jamie Pollyanna had forgotten that Mrs. Carew was so lovely . Then she turned to Sadie Dean, who was a very different Sadie . Poll Aunt Pollyanna's dreaded meeting with the Carew party passed off much better than she had feared . ""I wonder if anybody feeds him Mrs. Carew and Jamie had been at the Harrington homestead nearly a week when John Pendleton and Jimmy called . ""You are such good friends of mine Mrs. Carew referred again to the curiously haunting feeling that somewhere she had seen young Pendleton before . ""I'm so glad! I do, Mrs. Carew and her good friends, the Pendletons, were becoming delightfully acquainted with her . Pollyanna scolded one day, after Aunt Polly said it was all very good and well and desirable John Pendleton should have gotten out of the sour, morose aloofness that had John Pendleton's new touring car came to an end at four o'clock . It was a delight growing more poignant with every new vista through ""I know you didn't think,"" Pollyanna turned to Sadie Dean . She saw Jamie, his whole self alert, deftly balance his weight on Sadie Dean spoke of the new Home, and of what Mrs. Carew had done for her . ""I think you mean, because the world is shut out,""  ""I believe I am Jamie Kent. I've believed it quite a while,"" Pollyanna said . ""I know she does--and that would only hurt ""I've been thinking. I believe--I'll write stories,"" says Aunt Pollyanna . ""You don't think I can ever do it?"" ""I'm always repeating those you tell, and I always laugh and cry, too,"" says Pollyanna . ""You could do it lovely, I know!"" Pollyanna's eyes flew wide open, and she was silenced . ""I'd so LOVE to be beautiful--though of course it sounds silly to Pollyanna saw the goldenrod she immediately coveted . It was strange how tantalizing was that goldenrod . She knew she dropped her goldenrod and ran- ""Did you fall? Are you hurt?"" asked Jimmy . ""Don't say--anything. I didn't mean to make a scene- Pollyanna had hoped that the unhappy episode of the angry bull would be forgotten . But in all fairness she could not blame the others if they could not  Jimmy Pendleton knew very well that he was in love with Pollyanna . He knew that even his beloved bridges were as nothing when weighed against the smile It was Jimmy's life's happiness, but it was a different case . It might even be Pollyanna's happy life, too . But it ""Where have your eyes been? She worships him! I mean--they worship each other,"" she corrected hastily . Jimmy Pendleton turned and walked The Packet dated back to Jimmy's boyhood and had never been mentioned to any one save to John Pendleton . There were times when Jimmy speculated Pollyanna Whittier bestirred herself to be very gay and lively indeed . As it happened, Aunt Polly was beginning to worry again, audibly, Aunt Pollyanna drew a black line through the three words and poised the pencil for a fresh start . At this juncture Aunt Poll Milly Snow was a forlorn little runaway lad from the Orphans' Home . ""I don't believe I'd better count too much ""MRS. SNOW!"" protested Pollyanna, in genuine distress . ""Oh, Mrs. Snow, was I really ever quite so-impert Pollyanna's story was so beautifully typewritten by Milly Snow . ""I don't know, anyhow, but I'm glad 'tis ""I'd like to drop in on them about now,"" murmured Pollyanna . ""You mean--?"" she faltered . John Pend John Pendleton says Pollyanna is a ""very beautiful woman"" Countless little circumstances of the past summer flocked to her memory, mute witnesses Pollyanna was not finding it very easy these days to play the game, but was playing it faithfully, valiantly . Aunt Polly was not playing it at Aunt Pollyanna sighed at her aunt's door . ""You'll be glad I wasn't when you find what I've been doing Aunt Pollyanna turned with an impatient gesture . ""Dear me, child, you look tired to death!"" she fumed . Pollyanne clappe Aunt Pollyanna threw up her hands with a gesture of half-laughing despair . ""I'll confess myself beaten at my own game,"" JAMIE Pollyanna was not the only one that was finding that winter a hard one . Jimmy Pendleton was convinced that Jamie and Mrs. Carew care ""If only they'd settle things and announce the engagement, once for all,"" cried Jimmy . ""I'd like to tell you. May I? I' ""Of course, maybe I ought not to do that last, even now,"" said Jamie . ""I can't forget, of course, when I saw Polly ""Why, I thought he was with--all of us,"" murmured Mrs. Carew . ""I think I do--now that you speak ""Jimmy!"" gasped Pollyanna, falling back with startled eyes . ""I wanted--that is, I thought--I feared-- Pollyanna stooped suddenly, and picked up a leaf at her feet . When she rose, her face was turned quite away .

The Prince," Jonathan. His zeal carried him into battle. His faithfulness won him honor among his people. His humility led him into friendship with the man who would become king in his place. David was a man after God's own heart. But it was the courage and selflessness of his best friend that opened the door to David's rule. A man of honor and deep faith. Jonathan.
","INTRODUCTION Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469 . From 1494 to 1512 held an official post at Florence . Imprisoned in Florence, 1512; later ex Machiavelli died within a few weeks of the expulsion of the Medici . OFFICE — t. 25-43—1494-1512 In his “History of Florence,” he shows why youth Machiavelli’s public life was largely occupied with events arising out of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of Machiavelli reveals the secret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without force of character . he has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as the man who accomplished great things under the clo Machiavelli was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512 . He was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici . The new pope, Leo X, procured his Machiavelli commenced his “Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius” in 1518 . In 1519 the Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her citizens Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced retirement from affairs  In translating _The Prince_ my aim has been to achieve at all costs an exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression . To an Englishman of Shakespeare’ Di Piero De’ Medici Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most precious, or in which they see him take most delight . I trust much The PRINCE CHAPTER I. HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED . Principalities are either hereditary, in Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it . to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico’s own forces, because those who had opened the gates to him would if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them . but if he is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours . he has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority Louis XII, King of France, “The Father of the People” born 1462, died 1515 . Charles VIII was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lomb king regained authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of For Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Britany for the crown . if another a general rule is drawn which never fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by if once the Turk has been conquered, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory if cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, they cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern themselves . because such a government, being created by the prince, knows that a wise man should always follow the paths beaten by great men, and imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it . he says in the difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security . this coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 BC. CHAPTER VII. These are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it . They have not any Cesare Borgia, called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be the duke weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, giving them good pay, and honouring them with office and command in such a Ramiro d’Orco, a swift and cruel man, restored peace and unity with the greatest success . he had no doubt that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503. if he had not had those armies on his back, he would have overcome all difficulties . Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San Pietro he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to extermin Amilcar, the Carthaginian, was fighting in Sicily with his army . he was able to defend his city, but left part of his men for its defence . Agathocles, born 361 B.C Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo . After these murders he rode up and down the town and besieged chief magistrate . the badly employed are those which multiply with time rather than decrease . It is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves . Mr Burd suggests this word probably comes near the modern equivalent of Machiavelli’s thought . the people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority . but he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under Flamininus in 195 B.C., killed 192 B. C. [2] Messer Giorgio Scali in Florence  a wise prince should adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful . if a prince has such power,  a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, and then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold .  Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494 . Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who brought about all those things which I have discussed above . Pope Leo found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues . he mercenary captains are either capable men or not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them . they have been favoured by chance, for of the able captain Giovanni Acuto, an English knight whose name was Sir John Hawkwood, died in Florence in 1394 . he was born about 1320 at Sible Hedingham, a village in Essex . He married Domnia, the Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their troubles . a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit dean obeidallah: the wise prince has always avoided these arms and turned to his own . he says he has been willing rather to lose with them than conquer with others . but he enlisted the Orsin Charles VII of France, surnamed ""The Victorious,"" died 1461 . Louis XI, son of the above, died 1483 . if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him a prince who does not understand the art of war cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them . he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this knowledge is useful in two ways, the one by Philopoemen, ""the last of the Greeks,"" died 183 B.C. to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term . it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity . therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean . he says There is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated  a prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, but when it approaches they turn against you . fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails . he must do it on The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature . This disposition a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him . nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance . of this endless contro alla fede and “tutto fede” were omitted in the Testina edition . It may be that the meaning attached to the word “fede” was “the faith,” _i.e_ a prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he can only be attacked with difficulty . he says when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which  a prince should reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem, but when it bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody . Machiavelli’s strong condemnation of conspir a prince should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king . from this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach and keep those of grace in their own Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander were all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant . from these causes it arose that Marcus came to a sad end except Marcus . astonished and awed, and the former respectful and satisfied . Severus, as a new prince, was able to hold the empire so well . he was a warlike man, most enduring of Antoninus had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which proved the emperor’s ruin . it remains to discuss the character of Maximinus the kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends . a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions there never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects . but when he has found them disarmed, those who were distrusted become faithful . And when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrus princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she wants to make a new prince great . For this reason many consider that a wise prince ought with craft to foster some it has been a custom with princes to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them . Messer Nicolo Vitelli has been seen to demolish a prince should always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man . if you declare yourself and to make war strenuously, because if one of your powerful neighbours come to blows Antiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the tolians to drive out the Romans . He sent envoys to the Achaeans, exhorting them to remain neutral, and on the other hand the prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil . A prince should also show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art . Messer Antonio da Venafro was the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena . he says if he was not in the first rank, he can recognize the good and the bad in his Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire . He married, first, Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus became involved in if a prince is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to unite them . if the counsellors think of his own interests, the prince if others fail, it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that . This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character . he believes that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff would have done . because he had waited in Rome until he could get away, he would never have succeeded . if circumstances had arisen which required him to Giuliano de Medici was created a cardinal by Leo X, and took the title of Clement VII . With us there is great justice, because that war is just which is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there It is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian valour . For the Spaniards cannot resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, Gian Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, offered shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies . The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because he found himself disarmed and war at his door . Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino, fled to Venice, having destroyed all the fortresses in his state . if he did not wish to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they would besiege Sinig Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto arrived in Fano, a river five miles away from Fano . The duke ordered all his horsemen and infantry to  Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death . When he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke Vitellozzo and Oliverotto were strangled in the same way on 18th January 1502 in the castle of Pieve . it appears that all men, or the larger number of them, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and  Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have access to it without difficulty . Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Mess Messer Francesco gave Castruccio the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able to hold him much longer . Castru Messer Francesco died of tyrannical intentions in Lucca . He appointed Castruccio to be his son's tutor and administrator of his estate . Upon the death of Francesco he became the governor and tutor Uguccione drew from Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in hands of Castruccio . On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to attack . The loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and Castruccio gathered his friends around him, and attacked Uguccione . The Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven out of Pisa . At Messer Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza . Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San Miniato  Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into prison and put to death . The Florentines had recovered San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Pistoia passed into the hands of Castruccio, who forced the Signoria to leave the palace, and compelled the people to yield obedience to him . About this time great disturbances arose in Rome,  the Florentines entered the Pistoian territories . On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army . he decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pescia, nor to await Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle . The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army which was In commemoration of the defeat of the Florentines, Benedetto Lanfranchi seized Pistoia and put him to death, and drove their families into exile . In the early part of May 1328, Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in Pisan district . he assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry  both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield . Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florent Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the day, and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest contented . Thou hast for neighbours the offended Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utter Castruccio was a man of exceptional abilities, measured by men of his own time . In stature he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned . He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies . A friend gave him a curiously tied knot to undo and was told: “Fool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten” Castruccio said to Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled blindfolded .

The Confession," In 1998, Travis Boyette abducted and raped Nicole ""Nikki"" Yarber, a teenage girl and high school student in Slone, Texas and buried her body in Joplin, Missouri some 6 hours from Slone. He watches unfazed as the police arrest and convict Donté Drumm, a black high school football player with no connection with the crime. Despite his innocence, Drumm is convicted and sentenced to death. He has been on death row for nine years when the story takes place. While Drumm serves his prison sentence, lawyer Robbert ""Robbie"" Flak fights his case while Black Americans protest his false conviction, creating a law and order situation. Meanwhile, Boyette had fled to Kansas and had lived there ever since. He had been suffering with brain tumor for the past nine years and his health had deteriorated. In 2007, with Drumm's execution only a week away, reflecting on his miserable life, he decides to do what is right; confess. He meets a priest Reverend Keith Schroeder who takes him to Slone. Despite his confession to the public, the execution proceeds on and Drumm is executed by lethal injection. Boyette then reveals the resting place of Nikki and DNA samples show signs of rape and assault on her body.
","The Confession Author: Mary Roberts Rinehart Posting Date: September 26, 2008 [EBook #1963] Release Date: November, 1999 . I am objective rather than subjective, and a fairly full experience of life has taught me that most of my impressions are from within out rather than the other way about . Maggie, my old servant, was haunted by church-bells and considered it Miss Emily Benton wished to rent the house, Miss Blakiston . ""You and I know that the price is absurd,"" he exclaimed . Mrs Benton's instructions are to rent it, if I have to give it away,"" she said . ""Will you forgive me for saying that you are so exactly the person I should like to see in the house that I feel I can not give you up,"" says Emily Benton . Mrs. Benton was a frail little old lady, her small figure stiffly erect, her eyes cold, her whole bearing one of reserve . she says the benton house was to be occupied by an alien ""I can't explain it, any more than I can explain a cold in the head,"" she says . ""I've just got a feeling about it, Miss Agnes,"" she adds . if thoughts carry, as I am sure they do, then emotions carry, she writes . Miss Emily was so consistent, so consistently frail and dainty and so gentle, yet as time went on I began to feel that she hated Maggie with a real hatred . Willie, who came down over a Sunday early in the summer, possibly voiced it when he came down to his breakfast there . ""You're shaking all over. And go out and shut the door,"" ""I am afraid of the telephone,"" Willie says . ""I'm desperately sure you will never understand. Because I don't. I can hardly force myself to go to it,"" he tells me . I'm trying to set things down, he says. ""The whole thing is idiotic, anyhow."" ""I have to go downstairs at night and answer it,"" I says ""Why do Maggie and Miss Benton distrust each other?"" I realized it even then, although I did not consider it serious, as is evidenced by the fact that I follow it with a recipe for fruit gelatin, copied from the newspaper . I am rather casual as to seams, but I find I can not put it into words, unless it was that her back settled into more rigid lines . ""I'm going out,"" said Maggie on one of these occasions, and edged into the room . ""You know perfectly well that I dislike having the beds disturbed until nine o'clock, Miss Agnes."" ""You said that last night, but you didn't go,"" she said . Maggie's fear of the calls extended itself in a few days . on the fourth of August I find in my journal the single word ""flour"" it recalls both my own cowardice at that time, and an experiment I made . I was afraid of the night visitor, but, more than that, I was scared of the fear . In all the uneasiness of the past few weeks I had at least had full confidence in myself . I began to wonder how much of the things that had troubled me were real . The effect of the discovery on me was undermining, and now that was gone . ""If I don't kill it, we'll have a million. There, it's on the mantel now. I never--"" I felt that if she raised the paper club once more I should scream . ""Maggie--I can't stand it!"" ""My God, Miss Agnes!"" I said, and sat down . I was trem burying is not destroying the mind's a queer thing . Then we get tired or nervous--maybe just holding the thing down and pretending it is not there makes us nervous . ""I daresay you don't contend that I go out at night and call the house, and then come back and answer the call, do you?"" he asked . I thought it probable that she did not approve of conversing before servants . When she went out, Miss Emily turned to me. ""She looks sharp,"" said Miss Emily . ""Why not just ignore it? If some one is playing a malicious trick on you, the only thing is to ignore it"" ""What I want to know is this,"" Miss Agnes says . I put fresh candles in all the holders downstairs, and lock myself in my room and throw the key over the transom to Maggie . At ten-thirty, I was undressed, and Maggie had locked me in, a moment later, the telephone rang . ""You're not going downstairs,"" Maggie says, in a quavering voice . ""You go to bed and don't listen. There'll be nothing there, for all your trouble,"" she says . I resented the jarring sound of the bell, but still it was not the fear . Miss Emily, a quiet and very dignified voice, apologized I was the victim of a fear I was determined to conquer. The house was quiet. The cat slept on the shawl, and then--I felt the fear returning . I was afraid to shriek. I longed to escape. I did not move. There had been no sound, no motion. Things were as they had been. I do not know. I only know that I  Miss Emily had been very nervous since her brother's death, and small things upset her . She was so small and frail, I felt almost a motherly anxiety for her that morning . ""I think I should do it, if you don't mind. We are old friends. He always comes promptly when I call him,"" she said . Miss Emily asked the hackman about his family and stopped the vehicle to pick up a peddler . I thought she put her hand to her throat, but the next moment she was only adjusting the ruching at her neck . ""I think not, dear Miss Emily,"" she said at last, smiling at her drawn face . Miss Emily's father, Reverend Samuel Thaddeus Benton, died of the inscription . ""I'm not going, Miss Agnes,"" she said, but she never learns this fact . She always thinks that she is really going, until the last . ""I'm not going to desert you in your hour of need,"" she demanded . ""Mark my words, Miss Agnes,"" she said, ""she's going to destroy the place"" ""What made her set out and rent it for almost nothing if she isn't?"" I demanded as ungrammatical and hardly less uneasy than Maggie . The jelly was forgotten, Miss Agnes. It's clear under!"" ""Good heavens, Maggie! What difference does it make?"" ""W'you mind if I got the ice-pick and unscrewed the box?"" ""I'll get the jelly off,"" she said, and then maybe a hat pin'll reach it . I was roused by the feeling that some one I looked at the paper. I read it with my eyes, but I did not grasp it . It was not note paper, it was torn from a tablet of glazed and ruled paper . The scrap was the full width of the sheet, but only three inches deep . I whirled on her, in a fury that was only an outlet for my own shock . I spent the rest of the day in the library, going out for dinner, but returning to my refuge immediately after . Maggie's respect for books she never reads makes her regard a library as at least semi-holy ground . Both crime and confession indicated a degree of impulse that Miss Emily did not possess, she says . It was impossible to reconstruct in that quiet house a scene of violence . It was equally impossible to connect Miss Emily with it, but she knew of the confession . I was completely at a loss when I put out the lights and prepared to close the house . ""You're a sensitive person, Miss Agnes,"" he says . ""You catch a lot of impressions that pass most people by,"" ""Two sources?"" ""You only think that. But to go further, you have been receiving waves of apprehension from another source"" ""You don't know her,"" I said . ""I've been slow in coming, Miss Blakiston,"" a visiting neighbor says . Mrs. Graves: ""She loves the place. It is--I cannot imagine why she rented the house"" ""I understand he was a great care,"" she says of the late clergyman . ""If you'll look it up you will probably find that the little lady had had either  Martin Sprague's paper contained details of the murder of a young woman by unknown assassin . he says if it was true, was it not in its own way as mysterious as everything else? he asks: was it true that Emily Benton had committed a crime? she asks if he was right, was he right? ""Fifty years of my Bolivar County,"" a letter for letter, was in the same hand . I refused to allow Maggie to use a tablet of glazed paper to tie up jelly-glasses . The news came through the grocery boy who came out every day on a bicycle . ""The boy says she's breaking up,"" she said quietly . Carlo Benton had died the year Miss Emily claimed to have done a murder . I looked at the memorial window once more, and I could almost visualize her gathering up the dead man's hateful books . Martin Sprague would say that he had been on her hands for a long time, both well and ill . I am efficient myself, I trust, but I modify it with intelligence . Jelly to her is an institution, not an inspiration . It is subject to certain rules and rites, of which not the least is the formal interment in the fruit closet . I am not quick, mentally, especially when it comes to logical thought . I daresay I am intuitive rather than logical . It was not by any process of reasoning . Mrs. Graves had been mistaken for Carlo Benton's proscribed books . She was at home and in a sort of flurried neatness that convinced me she had seen me from far up the road . Miss Emily was set on clearing out every trace, she said solemnly, ""it was a significant rite"" ""I think you must know, my dear,"" says Miss Emily . ""I thought that, perhaps,"" she says, but she did not . Miss Emily had given me my chance, and I had not taken it, she says . Supposed confession was true, how could I find out anything about it? I could not go to neighbors, but they were none too friendly as it was . I smuggled the shawl into the house, and it offered a problem at once . It has been my custom for years to knit bedroom-slippers for an old ladies' home in which I am interested . I confess that this last thought took hold on me . I ignored Maggie's cosmetic suggestions, but I knew she was right . She said she was sagging around the chin and tightening up some . In 1898 there were six entries, aggregating five hundred dollars . In 1902-1903 there were no entries at all, but in 1904 there was a single memorandum . The entire amount must have been close to twenty-five thousand dollars. Carlo Benton had been in Australia during those years . In his ""Fifty Years in Bolivar County,"" the Reverend Thaddeus had written diagonally the word ""Australia"" In 1902 and 1903, a record of sums paid by this harassed old man to a worthless son refused to be accounted for . ""I'm at my Christmas presents now,"" ""Of course I shall,"" she assured her. ""But--didn't the hackman see you packing the books?"" ""No, indeed. We packed them the afternoon after the funeral,"" she said . ""I have no desire to report the matter, of course. But some one has been calling the house repeatedly at night, listening until I reply,"" she replied . ""I want to have Miss Emily know that I am friendly--that I am willing to do anything to--to show my friendliness. Anything,"" she says . ""I'll give you time to think it over,"" she tells Anne Bullard . When I went away I was aware that her eyes followed me, anxious and thoughtful eyes . I knew nothing of it until I heard Willie shouting downstairs . ""Stop, or I'll fire!"" I cried out, in an agony of fright . I knew that there was complete silence in the house . But I hardly heard it then . ""What in blazes slammed that door?"" Willie said . ""He was here, in front of me. I laid my hand on his. He had a revolver in it,"" he said, and went toward the door . At the time, I felt my way back along the hall. I touched the cat, which had been sleeping on the telephone-stand . ""I think I'll get the car and scout around,"" Willie says . ""He doesn't want to shoot me, or he could have done it,"" he tells her . I shook his head when he saw me, ""Absolutely nothing"" Willie Lingard's theory was more than upheld by the facts, he says . Lingard: ""I'd hate to think he was mixed up in any shady business"" he said, ""you have only rented the house,"" but he didn't know what was happening . ""I think Miss Emily needs to be helped, to try to fasten a murder on her?"" I felt so strongly that Miss Emily could only be helped by being hurt, that whatever she was concealing, the long concealment was killing her . It is with no small pride--but without exultation, for in end it cost too much--that I point to the solution of one issue as my own In the city my neighborly instincts have died of a sort of brick wall apathy, but it comes to life again . Did the village know the story I was trying to learn, and was it determined I should never find out the truth? Or was it not the village at all, but one or two people who were determined to drive me away? ""I think you'd better give up the place and go back to town,"" he says . ""The fact is, of course, that the early theory won't hold,"" she said . But she said, ""I have the most curious feeling that she is depending on me,"" Martin said, in a sort of desperation . Miss Emily was surrounded by a conspiracy of silence, and it roused my antagonism . I caught the girl's eye, raised from her knitting and fixed on me with a peculiar intensity . ""I think I should not have told you,"" Miss Emily apologized . Anne Bullard and the doctor feared her as they did . She said good-by to Miss Emily, and I felt that she hardly breathed until I got safely to the street . I think she died calmly and bravely. She died in the act of trying to tell me what they had determined she should never tell . Anne Bullard had called to me that she feared there was a change, and I went into the sickroom . She burst out at me then, but she shook her head . ""If it is not true, you owe it to her, I think,"" she said . Miss Emily died in the first sleep she had had . Anne Bullard was buried from her home in the astonished rage of the congregation . she left her property all to Anne, who was, I felt, her murderers . Maggie's mental state during the days preceding the funeral was curious . Mrs. Graves confided to Maggie that her suspicion was justified . In tracing the mystery of the confession, I find that three apparently disconnected discoveries paved the way to its solution . Anne Bullard was shown the one Maggie had found, but she disclaimed it . I felt my sympathy for Anne's loneliness turning to genuine interest . ""I have never heard of any. But I have not been here long,"" I persisted . ""Walk quiet, Miss Agnes,"" she said, ""and don't say I didn't warn you. She's in the library,"" she told me . I was in a state of nervous terror by that time, terror and apprehension, she says . Anne Bullard had foiled her attempt in her own endeavor, a mistaken endeavor, I felt . But it was too late to let things be as they are, Anne asked . ""I shall burn it without reading,"" she replied . Anne had an envelope in one hand and a hatchet in the other . Miss Emily Benton has been dead for more than a year . To publish the letter, she feels that she is doing what that gentle fatalist would call following the hand of Providence . Anne Sprague has some of Miss Emily's feelings about it, although she denies it . ""If humiliation be a virtue--"" I read and heard Anne in the hall . She was so merciless to herself, so hideously calm, so exact as to dates and hours . ""I shall never forget the day she learned there was a child. It sickened her,"" he said . Carlo had never known deceit, and now she was obliged to practice it constantly . She bore it all, year after year, and it ate, like a cancer . ""I thought she was out of her mind. But she opened the door, and--"" He turned and glanced at Anne . He ran his fingers through his heavy hair .

Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania," Joseph, a young man, marries a wealthy woman just as he is discovering an even more powerful love with his new friend Philip and must contend with the revelation of his wife's manipulative nature as well as his increasing feelings for Philip.

Dawn," 14-year-old Dawn Longchamp leads a humble, rootless existence with her parents, Ormond and Sally Jean Longchamp, and her moody older brother Jimmy, who is 16-years-old. Moving around a lot, Dawn's family does not provide much stability for her, but what her lifestyle lacks in stability, her home life makes up for in love. This erratic lifestyle seems to change when Dawn and Jimmy are able to enroll in an exclusive private school when Ormond gets a job there. It is here that Dawn's talent for singing is discovered. Her brother does not enjoy the school, feeling the weight of class differences bear down upon him. Dawn, although optimistic, does not fare much better, and is sternly ordered by the headmistress to be on her best behavior as she is of lesser social status than her classroom peers. On her first day, she also incurs the wrath of the most popular and affluent girl in the school, Clara Sue Cutler, after accidentally ratting her out on her smoking. Clara Sue then proceeds to pull mean-spirited pranks on Dawn and openly refers to her as white trash. Deeply offended, Dawn finally stops trying to like Clara Sue after this insult. However, Clara Sue's older brother, the handsome and charming Philip Cutler, does not share his sister's loathing. Phillip is kind to Dawn, and immediately shows an interest in her. He compares her beauty to that of his mother, Laura Sue Cutler, and is easily entranced. Jimmy is wary of Phillip, but does not overtly oppose Dawn's involvement with him. A shy girl who has had a sheltered upbringing, Dawn is somewhat taken aback by Phillip's immediate romantic overtures, even though she does find him attractive. Phillip urges her to date him, and after constant persuasion from him, Dawn agrees. Meanwhile, Dawn's mother, Sally Jean, has discovered that she is pregnant. This strains the Longchamps' finances, which are already tight, but Dawn is still overjoyed at the prospect of a little sibling, hoping that the baby will look more like her. Sally Jean gives birth to a little girl named Fern, but does not recover her health after the labor. She attempts several holistic ways of recovering her health but to no avail. She remains bedridden for the duration of Dawn's school year. At school, Dawn is excited by the musical opportunities now opening up to her. Her enjoyment of music culminates in her solo song, Somewhere over the Rainbow, at a school concert. Although nervous because of a prank pulled earlier by Clara Sue and her clique, Dawn draws emotional strength from the pearl necklace Sally Jean gave her earlier in the evening, which she claims are a Longchamp heirloom. Dawn's world comes crashing down after her solo performance at the school concert. Her beloved mother, Sally Jean, passes away that night. With the shock of this barely registered, what comes on the heels of Sally Jean's death truly changes Dawn's life forever. A security guard at the hospital where Sally Jean died recognizes the family, and also notices something peculiar in Dawn's appearance. He goes to the authorities, who perform an early morning raid of the Longchamp residence. Through these officers, it is revealed to Dawn that she is not Ormond and Sally Jean's biological daughter, but that she was kidnapped by them as a newborn baby, and that she is actually the daughter of Randolph and Laura Sue Cutler. Dawn is taken back to Cutler's Cove, Virginia, an offshoot of Virginia Beach. Ormond is arrested for child kidnapping. With no nearby relatives to come to their aid, Jimmy and Fern are placed in foster care. Dawn refuses to believe that Ormond kidnapped her, but the authorities prove her identity through a unique birthmark she shares with the description of the kidnapped baby. Dawn is appalled at the realization that the terrible Clara Sue is her sister; even worse, her boyfriend, Phillip, is actually her brother. These concerns fade into the background after her first meeting with Grandmother Cutler at the family's hotel, also named Cutler's Cove. Grandmother Cutler does not seem overjoyed about the return of her long-lost grandchild. She informs Dawn that she will be known by her ""true"" name, Eugenia, and that she will work in the hotel as a maid in order to prove that she is trustworthy. Dawn is shocked and upset by this cold treatment. She tries appealing to her real parents, Randolph and Laura Sue, but they are just as powerless as her. Randolph, though charming and handsome, has little willpower and prefers life to be as smooth as possible. Laura Sue is enchanted by Dawn's prettiness and resemblance to her, but refuses to make any effort to help her, as she is completely cowed by her mother-in-law. Dawn is also put at risk by Clara Sue's malicious tricks. Infuriated by Dawn's return, she does her best to make sure Dawn is fired by stealing jewellery and other items from the hotel guests. Dawn finds some comfort in the housekeeper, Mrs. Boston, who knew Sally Jean and Ormond Longchamp when they worked at the hotel. She cannot believe that her parents stole her, as they were always honest, hard-working people. Mrs. Boston hints that there is more to the ""kidnapping"" than meets the eye. Dawn's life is further brightened by a secret visit from Jimmy, aided and abetted by Phillip. Jimmy confesses that he has been in love with Dawn since they were children, but never dared show it because he felt he was sick for thinking of her that way. Dawn admits the attraction is mutual, but they find it hard to overcome their upbringing as brother and sister. This happy interlude comes to an end when Clara Sue finds Jimmy in the basement, where Dawn hid him. She tells Grandmother Cutler, who goes to the police and has Jimmy taken back to his foster parents. Dawn is heart-broken that Jimmy has to leave and is furious with Clara Sue. Jealous of her obvious affection for Jimmy, Phillip corners Dawn in her bathroom and rapes her. Desperate to get out, Dawn visits Mrs. Dalton, the woman who took care of her just after she was born, and learns that her ""kidnapping"" was staged by Grandmother Cutler because Randolph was not her biological father, as her mother had extramarital affairs, and didn't want a non-Culter child to receive benefits from the family. The Longchamps were paid with family jewels, including Dawn's pearls, to keep them quiet and to provide for Dawn and Jimmy. Outraged, Dawn confronts Grandmother Cutler about this. The old woman eventually agrees that she was the instigator and makes Dawn a deal: if Dawn will go to a singing school in New York, she will get Ormond out of prison. Dawn agrees but on one condition: that she be referred to by Dawn, not Eugenia. The book ends with Dawn going to New York.

The Prince," The work has a recognizable structure, for the most part indicated by the author himself, which can be summarized as follows. The Prince starts by describing the subject matter it will handle. In the first sentence Machiavelli uses the word ""state"" (Italian stato which could also mean ""status"") in order to neutrally cover ""all forms of organization of supreme political power, whether republican or princely"". The way in which the word state came to acquire this modern type of meaning during the Renaissance has been the subject of many academic discussions, with this sentence and similar ones in the works of Machiavelli being considered particularly important. Machiavelli said that The Prince would be about princedoms, mentioning that he has written about republics elsewhere (possibly referring to the Discourses on Livy although this is debated), but in fact he mixes discussion of republics into this in many places, effectively treating republics as a type of princedom also, and one with many strengths. More importantly, and less traditionally, he distinguishes new princedoms from hereditary established princedoms. He deals with hereditary princedoms quickly in Chapter 2, saying that they are much easier to rule. For such a prince, ""unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him"". , comparing to traditional presentations of advice for princes, stated that the novelty in chapters 1 and 2 is the ""deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom"". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. He thinks Machiavelli may have been influenced by Tacitus as well his own experience, but finds no clear predecessor for this. This categorization of regime types is also ""un-Aristotelian"" and apparently simpler than the traditional one found for example in Aristotle's Politics, which divides regimes into those ruled by a single monarch, an oligarchy, or by the people, in a democracy. He also ignores the classical distinctions between the good and corrupt forms, for example between monarchy and tyranny. points out that Machiavelli frequently uses the words ""prince"" and ""tyrant"" as synonyms, ""regardless of whether he speaks of criminal or non-criminal tyrants"". Xenophon, on the other hand, made exactly the same distinction between types of rulers in the opening of his Education of Cyrus where he says that, concerning the knowledge of how to rule human beings, Cyrus the Great, his exemplary prince, was very different ""from all other kings, both those who have inherited their thrones from their fathers and those who have gained their crowns by their own efforts"". Machiavelli divides the subject of new states into two types, ""mixed"" cases and purely new states. New princedoms are either totally new, or they are “mixed” meaning that they are new parts of an older state, already belonging to that prince. Machiavelli generalizes that there were several virtuous Roman ways to hold a newly acquired province, using a republic as an example of how new princes can act: *to install one's princedom in the new acquisition, or to install colonies of one's people there, which is better. *to indulge the lesser powers of the area without increasing their power. *to put down the powerful people. *not to allow a foreign power to gain reputation. More generally, Machiavelli emphasizes that one should have regard not only for present problems but also for the future ones. One should not “enjoy the benefit of time” but rather the benefit of one's virtue and prudence, because time can bring evil as well as good. In some cases the old king of the conquered kingdom depended on his lords. 16th century France, or in other words France as it was at the time of writing of the Prince, is given by Machiavelli as an example of such a kingdom. These are easy to enter but difficult to hold. When the kingdom revolves around the king, then it is difficult to enter but easy to hold. The solution is to eliminate the old bloodline of the prince. Machiavelli used the Persian empire of Darius III, conquered by Alexander the Great, to illustrate this point and then noted that the Medici, if they think about it, will find this historical example similar to the ""kingdom of the Turk"" (Ottoman Empire) in their time - making this a potentially easier conquest to hold than France would be. notes that this chapter is quite atypical of any previous books for princes. Gilbert supposed the need to discuss conquering free republics is linked to Machiavelli's project to unite Italy, which contained some free republics. As he also notes, the chapter in any case makes it clear that holding such a state is highly difficult for a prince. Machiavelli gives three options:- *Ruin them, like Rome destroyed Carthage, and also like Machiavelli says the Romans eventually had to do in Greece, even though they had wanted to avoid it. *Go to live there (or install colonies, if you are a prince of a republic). *Let them keep their own orders but install a puppet regime. But Machiavelli says this way is useless. Princes who rise to power through their own skill and resources (their ""virtue"") rather than luck tend to have a hard time rising to the top, but once they reach the top they are very secure in their position. This is because they effectively crush their opponents and earn great respect from everyone else. Because they are strong and more self-sufficient, they have to make fewer compromises with their allies. Machiavelli writes that reforming an existing order is one of the most dangerous and difficult things a prince can do. Part of the reason is that people are naturally resistant to change and reform. Those who benefited from the old order will resist change very fiercely. By contrast, those who stand to benefit from the new order will be less fierce in their support, because the new order is unfamiliar and they are not certain it will live up to its promises. Moreover, it is impossible for the prince to satisfy everybody's expectations. Inevitably, he will disappoint some of his followers. Therefore, a prince must have the means to force his supporters to keep supporting him even when they start having second thoughts, otherwise he will lose his power. Only armed prophets, like Moses, succeed in bringing lasting change. Machiavelli claims that Moses killed uncountable numbers of his own people in order to enforce his will. Machiavelli was not the first thinker to notice this pattern. Allan Gilbert wrote: ""In wishing new laws and yet seeing danger in them Machiavelli was not himself an innovator,"" because this idea was traditional and could be found in Aristotle's writings. But Machiavelli went much further than any other author in his emphasis on this aim, and Gilbert associates Machiavelli's emphasis upon such drastic aims with the level of corruption to be found in Italy. According to Machiavelli, when a prince comes to power through luck or the blessings of powerful figures within the regime, he typically has an easy time gaining power but a hard time keeping it thereafter, because his power is dependent on his benefactors' goodwill. He does not command the loyalty of the armies and officials that maintain his authority, and these can be withdrawn from him at a whim. Having risen the easy way, it is not even certain such a prince has the skill and strength to stand on his own feet. This is not necessarily true in every case. Machiavelli cites Cesare Borgia as an example of a lucky prince who escaped this pattern. Through cunning political maneuvers, he managed to secure his power base. Cesare was made commander of the papal armies by his father, Pope Alexander VI, but was also heavily dependent on mercenary armies loyal to the Orsini brothers and the support of the French king. Borgia won over the allegiance of the Orsini's followers with better pay and prestigious government posts. When some of his mercenary captains started to plot against him, he had them imprisoned and executed. When it looked like the king of France would to abandon him, Borgia sought new alliances. Finally, Machiavelli makes a point that bringing new benefits to a conquered people will not be enough to cancel the memory of old injuries, an idea Allan Gilbert said can be found in Tacitus and Seneca the Younger. Conquests by ""criminal virtue"" are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel, immoral deeds, such as the execution of political rivals. Machiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power, and then execute them all in one stroke, such that he need not commit any more wickedness for the rest of his reign. In this way, his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and his reputation can recover. Princes who fail to do this, who hesitate in their ruthlessness, find that their problems mushroom over time and they are forced to commit wicked deeds throughout their reign. Thus they continuously mar their reputations and alienate their people. Machiavelli's case study is Agathocles of Syracuse. After Agathocles became Praetor of Syracuse, he called a meeting of the city's elite. At his signal, his soldiers killed all the senators and the wealthiest citizens, completely destroying the old oligarchy. He declared himself ruler with no opposition. So secure was his power that he could afford to absent himself to go off on military campaigns in Africa. remarks that this chapter is even less traditional than those it follows, not only in its treatment of criminal behavior, but also in the advice to take power from people at a stroke, noting that precisely the opposite had been advised by Aristotle in his Politics (5.11.1315a13). On the other hand Gilbert shows that another piece of advice in this chapter, to give benefits when it will not appear forced, was traditional. These ""civic principalities"" do not require real virtue, only “fortunate astuteness”. Machiavelli breaks this case into two basic types, depending upon which section of the populace supports the new prince. =====Supported by the great (those who wish to command the people)===== This, according to Machiavelli, is an unstable situation, which must be avoided after the initial coming to power. The great should be made and unmade every day at your convenience. There are two types of great people that might be encountered:- # Those who are bound to the prince. Concerning these it is important to distinguish between two types of obligated great people, those who are rapacious and those who are not. It is the latter who can and should be honoured. # Those who are not bound to the new prince. Once again these need to be divided into two types:- Those with a weak spirit. A prince can make use of them if they are of good counsel; Those who shun being bound because of their own ambition. These should be watched and feared as enemies. =====Supported by the people (those who wish not to be commanded by the great)===== How to win over people depends on circumstances. Machiavelli advises:- *Do not get frightened in adversity. *One should avoid ruling via magistrates, if one wishes to be able to “ascend” to absolute rule quickly and safely. *One should make sure that the people need the prince, especially if a time of need should come. The way to judge the strength of a princedom is to see whether it can defend itself, or whether it needs to depend on allies. This does not just mean that the cities should be prepared and the people trained. A prince who is hated is also exposed. This type of ""princedom"" refers for example explicitly to the Catholic church, which is of course not traditionally thought of as a princedom. According to Machiavelli, these are relatively easy to maintain, once founded. They do not need to defend themselves militarily, nor to govern their subjects. Machiavelli discusses the recent history of the Church as if it were a princedom that was in competition to conquer Italy against other princes. He points to factionalism as a historical weak point in the Church, and points to the recent example of the Borgia family as a better strategy which almost worked. He then explicitly proposes that the Medici are now in a position to try the same thing. Having discussed the various types of principalities, Machiavelli turns to the ways a state can attack other territories or defend itself. The two most essential foundations for any state, whether old or new, are sound laws and strong military forces. A self-sufficient prince is one who can meet any enemy on the battlefield. He should be ""armed"" with his own arms. However, a prince that relies solely on fortifications or on the help of others and stands on the defensive is not self-sufficient. If he cannot raise a formidable army, but must rely on defense, he must fortify his city. A well-fortified city is unlikely to be attacked, and if it is, most armies cannot endure an extended siege. However, during a siege a virtuous prince will keep the morale of his subjects high while removing all dissenters. Thus, as long as the city is properly defended and has enough supplies, a wise prince can withstand any siege. Machiavelli stands strongly against the use of mercenaries, and in this he was innovative, and he also had personal experience in Florence. He believes they are useless to a ruler because they are undisciplined, cowardly, and without any loyalty, being motivated only by money. Machiavelli attributes the Italian city states’ weakness to their reliance on mercenary armies. Machiavelli also warns against using auxiliary forces, troops borrowed from an ally, because if they win, the employer is under their favor and if they lose, he is ruined. Auxiliary forces are more dangerous than mercenary forces because they are united and controlled by capable leaders who may turn against the employer. The main concern for a prince should be war, or the preparation thereof, not books. Through war a hereditary prince maintains his power or a private citizen rises to power. Machiavelli advises that a prince must frequently hunt in order to keep his body fit and learn the landscape surrounding his kingdom. Through this, he can best learn how to protect his territory and advance upon others. For intellectual strength, he is advised to study great military men so he may imitate their successes and avoid their mistakes. A prince who is diligent in times of peace will be ready in times of adversity. Machiavelli writes, “thus, when fortune turns against him he will be prepared to resist it.” Each of the following chapters presents a discussion about a particular virtue or vice that a prince might have, and is therefore structured in a way which appears like traditional advice for a prince. However the advice is far from traditional. Machiavelli believes that a prince's main focus should be on perfecting the art of war. He believes that by taking this profession a ruler will be able to protect his kingdom. He claims that ""being disarmed makes you despised."" He believes that the only way to ensure loyalty from one's soldiers is to understand military matters. The two activities Machiavelli recommends practicing to prepare for war are physical and mental. Physically, he believes rulers should learn the landscape of their territories. Mentally, he encouraged the study of past military events. He also warns against idleness. Because, says Machiavelli, he wants to write something useful to those who understand, he thought it more fitting ""to go directly to the effectual truth (""verità effettuale"") of the thing than to the imagination of it"". This section is one where Machiavelli’s pragmatic ideal can be seen most clearly. The prince should, ideally, be virtuous, but he should be willing and able to abandon those virtues if it becomes necessary. Concerning the behavior of a prince toward his subjects, Machiavelli announces that he will depart from what other writers say, and writes: Since there are many possible qualities that a prince can be said to possess, he must not be overly concerned about having all the good ones. Also, a prince may be perceived to be merciful, faithful, humane, frank, and religious, but most important is only to seem to have these qualities. A prince cannot truly have these qualities because at times it is necessary to act against them. In fact, he must sometimes deliberately choose evil. Although a bad reputation should be avoided, it is sometimes necessary to have one. If a prince is overly generous to his subjects, Machiavelli asserts he will not be appreciated, and will only cause greed for more. Additionally, being overly generous is not economical, because eventually all resources will be exhausted. This results in higher taxes, and will bring grief upon the prince. Then, if he decides to discontinue or limit his generosity, he will be labeled as a miser. Thus, Machiavelli summarizes that guarding against the people’s hatred is more important than building up a reputation for generosity. A wise prince should be willing to be more reputed a miser than be hated for trying to be too generous. On the other hand: ""of what is not yours or your subjects' one can be a bigger giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander, because spending what is someone else's does not take reputation from you but adds it to you; only spending your own hurts you"". In addressing the question of whether it is better to be loved or feared, Machiavelli writes, “The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other; but because it is difficult to combine them, it is far safer to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.” As Machiavelli asserts, commitments made in peace are not always kept in adversity; however, commitments made in fear are kept out of fear. Yet, a prince must ensure that he is not feared to the point of hatred, which is very possible. This chapter is possibly the most well-known of the work, and it is important because of the reasoning behind Machiavelli’s famous idea that it is better to be feared than loved – his justification is purely pragmatic; as he notes, “Men worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared.” Fear is simply a means to an end, and that end is security for the prince. The fear instilled should never be excessive, for that could be dangerous to the prince. Above all, Machiavelli argues, a prince should not interfere with the property of their subjects, their women, or the life of somebody without proper justification. Regarding the troops of the prince, fear is absolutely necessary to keep a large garrison united and a prince should not mind the thought of cruelty in that regard. For a prince who leads his own army, it is imperative for him to observe cruelty because that is the only way he can command his soldiers' absolute respect. Machiavelli compares two great military leaders: Hannibal and Scipio Africanus. Although Hannibal's army consisted of men of various races, they were never rebellious because they feared their leader. Machiavelli says this required ""inhuman cruelty"" which he refers to as a virtue. Scipio's men, on the other hand, were known for their mutiny and dissension, due to Scipio's ""excessive mercy"" - which was however a source of glory because he lived in a republic. Machiavelli notes that a prince is praised for keeping his word. However, he also notes that a prince is also praised for the illusion of being reliable in keeping his word. A prince, therefore, should only keep his word when it suits his purposes, but do his utmost to maintain the illusion that he does keep his word and that he is reliable in that regard. Therefore, a prince should not break his word unnecessarily. As Machiavelli notes, “He should appear to be compassionate, faithful to his word, guileless, and devout. And indeed he should be so. But his disposition should be such that, if he needs to be the opposite, he knows how.” As noted in chapter 15, the prince must appear to be virtuous, and should be virtuous, but he should be able to be otherwise when the time calls for it; that includes being able to lie, though however much he lies he should always keep the appearance of being truthful. Machiavelli observes that most men are content as long as they are not deprived of their property and women. A prince should command respect through his conduct, because a prince that is highly respected by his people is unlikely to face internal struggles. Additionally, a prince who does not raise the contempt of the nobles and keeps the people satisfied, Machiavelli assures, should have no fear of conspirators. Machiavelli advises monarchs to have both internal and external fears. Internal fears exist inside his kingdom and focus on his subjects, Machiavelli warns to be suspicious of everyone when hostile attitudes emerge. External fears are of foreign powers. Machiavelli mentions that placing fortresses in conquered territories, although it sometimes works, often fails. Using fortresses can be a good plan, but Machiavelli says he shall ""blame anyone who, trusting in fortresses, thinks little of being hated by the people"". A prince truly earns honor by completing great feats. King Ferdinand of Spain is cited by Machiavelli as an example of a monarch who gained esteem by showing his ability through great feats and who, in the name of religion, conquered many territories and kept his subjects occupied so that they had no chance to rebel. Regarding two warring states, Machiavelli asserts it is always wiser to choose a side, rather than to be neutral. Machiavelli then provides the following reasons why: * If your allies win, you benefit whether or not you have more power than they have. * If you are more powerful, then your allies are under your command; if your allies are stronger, they will always feel a certain obligation to you for your help. * If your side loses, you still have an ally in the loser. Machiavelli also notes that it is wise for a prince not to ally with a stronger force unless compelled to do so. In conclusion, the most important virtue is having the wisdom to discern what ventures will come with the most reward and then pursuing them courageously. The selection of good servants is reflected directly upon the prince’s intelligence, so if they are loyal, the prince is considered wise; however, when they are otherwise, the prince is open to adverse criticism. Machiavelli asserts that there are three types of intelligence: *The kind that understands things for itself—which is excellent to have. *The kind that understands what others can understand—which is good to have. *The kind that does not understand for itself, nor through others—which is useless to have. If the prince does not have the first type of intelligence, he should at the very least have the second type. For, as Machiavelli states, “A prince needs to have the discernment to recognize the good or bad in what another says or does even though he has no acumen himself"". This chapter shows a low opinion of flatterers; Machiavelli notes that “Men are so happily absorbed in their own affairs and indulge in such self-deception that it is difficult for them not to fall victim to this plague; and some efforts to protect oneself from flatterers involve the risk of becoming despised.” Flatterers were seen as a great danger to a prince, because their flattery could cause him to avoid wise counsel in favor of rash action, but avoiding all advice, flattery or otherwise, was equally bad; a middle road had to be taken. A prudent prince should have a select group of wise counselors to advise him truthfully on matters all the time. All their opinions should be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision should be made by the counselors and carried out absolutely. If a prince is given to changing his mind, his reputation will suffer. A prince must have the wisdom to recognize good advice from bad. Machiavelli gives a negative example in Emperor Maximilian I; Maximilian, who was secretive, never consulted others, but once he ordered his plans and met dissent, he immediately changed them. After first mentioning that a new prince can quickly become as respected as a hereditary one, Machiavelli says princes in Italy who had long standing power and lost it can not blame bad luck, but should blame their own indolence. One ""should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up"". They all showed: *A defect of arms, already discussed. *Either had a hostile populace or else they did not know to secure themselves with the great. As pointed out by it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but ""Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work"". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with ""sweat"", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that ""it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down."" Gilbert (p.&nbsp;217) points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to ""fortune and God"". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers un-controlled. Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book. showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed takes the Borgia family's recent and very controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often very brutally executed, as a positive example. This continues a controversial theme throughout the book.
","INTRODUCTION Nicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469 . From 1494 to 1512 held an official post at Florence . Imprisoned in Florence, 1512; later ex Machiavelli died within a few weeks of the expulsion of the Medici . OFFICE — t. 25-43—1494-1512 In his “History of Florence,” he shows why youth Machiavelli’s public life was largely occupied with events arising out of the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the Duke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of Machiavelli reveals the secret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man, without force of character . he has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as the man who accomplished great things under the clo Machiavelli was dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512 . He was accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici . The new pope, Leo X, procured his Machiavelli commenced his “Discourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius” in 1518 . In 1519 the Medicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her citizens Machiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and industry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and with his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced retirement from affairs  In translating _The Prince_ my aim has been to achieve at all costs an exact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent paraphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression . To an Englishman of Shakespeare’ Di Piero De’ Medici Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most precious, or in which they see him take most delight . I trust much The PRINCE CHAPTER I. HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED . Principalities are either hereditary, in Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it . to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico’s own forces, because those who had opened the gates to him would if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them . but if he is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one can no longer remedy them the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours . he has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority Louis XII, King of France, “The Father of the People” born 1462, died 1515 . Charles VIII was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lomb king regained authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of For Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Britany for the crown . if another a general rule is drawn which never fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by if once the Turk has been conquered, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory if cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, they cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern themselves . because such a government, being created by the prince, knows that a wise man should always follow the paths beaten by great men, and imitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour of it . he says in the difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security . this coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 BC. CHAPTER VII. These are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it . They have not any Cesare Borgia, called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be the duke weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, giving them good pay, and honouring them with office and command in such a Ramiro d’Orco, a swift and cruel man, restored peace and unity with the greatest success . he had no doubt that he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503. if he had not had those armies on his back, he would have overcome all difficulties . Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San Pietro he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to extermin Amilcar, the Carthaginian, was fighting in Sicily with his army . he was able to defend his city, but left part of his men for its defence . Agathocles, born 361 B.C Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo . After these murders he rode up and down the town and besieged chief magistrate . the badly employed are those which multiply with time rather than decrease . It is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves . Mr Burd suggests this word probably comes near the modern equivalent of Machiavelli’s thought . the people, finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his authority . but he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under Flamininus in 195 B.C., killed 192 B. C. [2] Messer Giorgio Scali in Florence  a wise prince should adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them faithful . if a prince has such power,  a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, and then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold .  Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494 . Alexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who brought about all those things which I have discussed above . Pope Leo found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues . he mercenary captains are either capable men or not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them . they have been favoured by chance, for of the able captain Giovanni Acuto, an English knight whose name was Sir John Hawkwood, died in Florence in 1394 . he was born about 1320 at Sible Hedingham, a village in Essex . He married Domnia, the Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their troubles . a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit dean obeidallah: the wise prince has always avoided these arms and turned to his own . he says he has been willing rather to lose with them than conquer with others . but he enlisted the Orsin Charles VII of France, surnamed ""The Victorious,"" died 1461 . Louis XI, son of the above, died 1483 . if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him a prince who does not understand the art of war cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them . he should addict himself more to its exercise than in war; this knowledge is useful in two ways, the one by Philopoemen, ""the last of the Greeks,"" died 183 B.C. to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term . it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity . therefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean . he says There is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated  a prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, but when it approaches they turn against you . fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails . he must do it on The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature . This disposition a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him . nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance . of this endless contro alla fede and “tutto fede” were omitted in the Testina edition . It may be that the meaning attached to the word “fede” was “the faith,” _i.e_ a prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he can only be attacked with difficulty . he says when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which  a prince should reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem, but when it bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody . Machiavelli’s strong condemnation of conspir a prince should be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king . from this one can draw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach and keep those of grace in their own Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander were all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant . from these causes it arose that Marcus came to a sad end except Marcus . astonished and awed, and the former respectful and satisfied . Severus, as a new prince, was able to hold the empire so well . he was a warlike man, most enduring of Antoninus had contumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which proved the emperor’s ruin . it remains to discuss the character of Maximinus the kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends . a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions there never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects . but when he has found them disarmed, those who were distrusted become faithful . And when you disarm them, you at once offend them by showing that you distrus princes become great when they overcome the difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore fortune, especially when she wants to make a new prince great . For this reason many consider that a wise prince ought with craft to foster some it has been a custom with princes to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them . Messer Nicolo Vitelli has been seen to demolish a prince should always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man . if you declare yourself and to make war strenuously, because if one of your powerful neighbours come to blows Antiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the tolians to drive out the Romans . He sent envoys to the Achaeans, exhorting them to remain neutral, and on the other hand the prudence consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to take the lesser evil . A prince should also show himself a patron of ability, and to honour the proficient in every art . Messer Antonio da Venafro was the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena . he says if he was not in the first rank, he can recognize the good and the bad in his Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire . He married, first, Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus became involved in if a prince is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to unite them . if the counsellors think of his own interests, the prince if others fail, it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for that . This again either does not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no avail which a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change of disposition or character . he believes that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that Julius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff would have done . because he had waited in Rome until he could get away, he would never have succeeded . if circumstances had arisen which required him to Giuliano de Medici was created a cardinal by Leo X, and took the title of Clement VII . With us there is great justice, because that war is just which is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there It is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian valour . For the Spaniards cannot resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, Gian Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, offered shelter and assistance to the duke against his enemies . The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because he found himself disarmed and war at his door . Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino, fled to Venice, having destroyed all the fortresses in his state . if he did not wish to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they would besiege Sinig Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto arrived in Fano, a river five miles away from Fano . The duke ordered all his horsemen and infantry to  Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his approaching death . When he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke Vitellozzo and Oliverotto were strangled in the same way on 18th January 1502 in the castle of Pieve . it appears that all men, or the larger number of them, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and  Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have access to it without difficulty .

Upon the death of Francesco he became the governor and tutor Uguccione drew from Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army in hands of Castruccio .

Emma," Emma Woodhouse, aged 20 at the start of the novel, is a young, beautiful, witty, and privileged woman in Regency England. She lives on the fictional estate of Hartfield in Surrey in the village of Highbury with her elderly widowed father, a hypochondriac who is excessively concerned for the health and safety of his loved ones. Emma's friend and only critic is the gentlemanly George Knightley, her neighbour from the adjacent estate of Donwell, and the brother of her elder sister Isabella's husband, John. As the novel opens, Emma has just attended the wedding of Miss Taylor, her best friend and former governess. Having introduced Miss Taylor to her future husband, Mr. Weston, Emma takes credit for their marriage, and decides that she rather likes matchmaking. Against Mr. Knightley's advice, Emma forges ahead with her new interest, and tries to match her new friend Harriet Smith, a sweet, pretty, but none-too-bright parlour boarder of seventeen &mdash;described as ""the natural daughter of somebody""&mdash; to Mr. Elton, the local vicar. Emma becomes convinced that Mr. Elton's constant attentions are a result of his attraction and growing love for Harriet. But before events can unfold as she plans, Emma must first persuade Harriet to refuse an advantageous marriage proposal. Her suitor is a respectable, educated, and well-spoken young gentleman farmer, Robert Martin, but Emma snobbishly decides he isn't good enough for Harriet. Against her own wishes, the easily-influenced Harriet rejects Mr. Martin. Emma's schemes go awry when Mr. Elton, a social climber, fancies Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. Emma's friends had suggested that Mr. Elton's attentions were really directed at her, but she had misread the signs. Emma, rather shocked and a bit insulted, tells Mr. Elton that she had thought him attached to Harriet; however Elton is outraged at the very idea of marrying the socially inferior Harriet. After Emma rejects Mr. Elton, he leaves for a while for a sojourn in Bath, and Harriet fancies herself heartbroken. Emma feels dreadful about misleading Harriet and resolves—briefly—to interfere less in people's lives. Mr. Elton, as Emma's misconceptions of his character melt away, reveals himself to be arrogant, resentful, and pompous. He soon returns from Bath with a pretentious, nouveau-riche wife who becomes part of Emma's social circle, though the two women soon loathe each other. The Eltons treat the still lovestruck Harriet deplorably, culminating with Mr Elton very publicly snubbing Harriet at a dance. Mr Knightley, who had until this moment refrained from dancing, gallantly steps in to partner Harriet, much to Emma's gratification. An interesting development is the arrival in the neighbourhood of the handsome and charming Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son, who had been given to his deceased wife's wealthy brother and his wife, the Churchills, to raise. Frank, who is now Mrs. Weston's stepson, and Emma have never met, but she has a long-standing interest in doing so. The whole neighborhood takes a fancy to him, with the partial exception of Mr. Knightley, who becomes uncharacteristically grumpy whenever his name is mentioned and suggests to Emma that while Frank is clever and engaging, he is also a rather shallow character. A third newcomer is the orphaned Jane Fairfax, the reserved, beautiful, and elegant niece of Emma's impoverished neighbour, the talkative Miss Bates, who lives with her deaf, widowed mother. Miss Bates is an aging spinster, well-meaning but increasingly poor; Emma strives to be polite and kind to her, but is irritated by her constant chattering. Jane, very gifted musically, is Miss Bates' pride and joy; Emma envies her talent, and although she has known Jane all her life has never warmed to her personally. Jane had lived with Miss Bates until she was nine, but Colonel Campbell, a friend of her father's, welcomed her into his own home, where she became fast friends with his daughter and received a first-rate education. But now Miss Campbell has married, and the accomplished but penniless Jane has returned to her Bates relations, ostensibly to regain her health and to prepare to earn her living as a governess. Emma is annoyed to find the entire neighborhood, including Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, singing Jane's praises, but when Mrs. Elton, who fancies herself the new leader of Highbury society, patronizingly takes Jane under her wing and announces that she will find her the ideal governess post, Emma begins to feel some sympathy for Jane's predicament. Still, Emma sees something mysterious in Jane's sudden return to Highbury and imagines that Jane and Miss Campbell's husband, Mr. Dixon, were mutually attracted, and that is why she has come home instead of going to Ireland to visit them. She shares her suspicions with Frank, who had become acquainted with Jane and the Campbells when they met at a vacation spot a year earlier, and he apparently agrees with her. Suspicions are further fueled when a piano, sent by an anonymous benefactor, arrives for Jane. Emma tries to make herself fall in love with Frank largely because almost everyone seems to expect it. Frank appears to be courting Emma, and the two flirt and banter together in public, at parties, and on a day-trip to Box Hill, a local beauty spot. However, when his demanding and ailing aunt, Mrs. Churchill, summons Frank home, Emma discovers she does not miss her ""lover"" nearly as much as she expected and sets about plotting a match between him and Harriet, who seems to have finally gotten over Mr. Elton. Harriet breathlessly reports that Frank has ""saved"" her from a band of Gypsies, and seems to be confessing her admiration for him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston wonders if Emma's old friend Mr. Knightley has taken a fancy to Jane. Emma immediately dismisses that idea and protests that she does not want Mr. Knightley to marry anyone, and that her little nephew Henry must inherit Donwell, the Knightley family property. When Mr. Knightley scolds her for a thoughtless insult to Miss Bates, Emma is stunned and ashamed and tries to atone by going to visit Miss Bates. Mr. Knightley is surprised and deeply impressed by Emma's recognition of her wrongdoing, but this meaningful rapprochement is broken off when he announces he must leave for London to visit his brother. Meanwhile, Jane reportedly becomes ill, but refuses to see Emma or accept her gifts, and it is suddenly announced that she has accepted a governess position from one of Mrs. Elton's friends. On the heels of this comes word that Frank Churchill's aunt has died, and with it the astonishing news that Frank and Jane have been secretly engaged since they first met on holiday a year ago. They had been keeping the engagement quiet because they knew that Frank's imperious aunt would disapprove and likely disinherit him if he went through with the match. The strain of the clandestine relationship had been much harder on the conscientious Jane than the carefree Frank, and the two had quarreled bitterly; but now that his aunt has died, his easygoing uncle has already given his blessing. The engagement becomes public, the secrets behind Jane and Frank's behavior are revealed, and Emma is chagrined to discover that once again she has been so wrong about so much. Emma is certain that Harriet will be devastated by Frank's engagement, but Harriet reassures her that this is not the case. In fact, Harriet tells Emma, it is Mr. Knightley who has captured her heart, and she believes he returns her feelings. Emma is dumbstruck over what she at first thinks is the impropriety of the match, but as she faces her feelings of dismay and jealousy, she realizes in a flash that she has long been in love with Mr. Knightley herself. She is shattered to think that it may be too late and resolves to support her dear friends in whatever they do, even at the cost of her own broken heart. However, when Mr. Knightley hurries back to Highbury to console Emma over what he imagines to be the loss of Frank Churchill, she discovers that he is also in love with her. He proposes and she joyfully accepts. There is one more match to be made: With encouragement from Mr. Knightley, the farmer Robert Martin proposes again to Harriet, and this time she accepts. Jane and Emma reconcile and all misunderstandings are cleared up before Jane and Frank leave for their wedding and life with his uncle in Yorkshire. Emma and Mr. Knightley decide that after their marriage they will live with Emma's father at Hartfield to spare Mr. Woodhouse loneliness and distress. They seem headed for a union of ""perfect happiness,"" to the great joy of their friends. Mrs. Weston gives birth to a baby girl, to the great satisfaction of Emma, who looks forward to introducing little Miss Weston to her young nephews.

In His Image," On a trip to Turin to analyse the Shroud of Turin, journalist Decker Hawthorne and Professor Harry Goodman discover human dermal cells remaining. After the trip, Goodman takes some samples back to his laboratory, in the United States, and discovers that they are still alive. He then invites Decker to show him his discoveries. Once Decker arrives, Goodman explains several of his theories about the cells, and has engineered a strain of ""C Cells"" which are incredibly resiliant to damage and disease. Goodman is actively searching for ways these C Cells could be implemented to insert into ones body to cure disease, due to their strange properties and signs of immortality. Then the professor proposes to Decker the idea of cloning the cells, but Decker does not support this idea. Some years pass and Decker visits professor Goodman with one of his two daughters. While Hawthorne and Goodman talk for some time, Decker's daughter meets and interacts with the Goodman's adopted son, Christopher. On the way back home, Decker deduces Christopher's origin. He immediately returns to Goodman's home and confronts him about Christopher being the Clone of Jesus Christ. Goodman explains that Christopther is like any usual boy, but that he shows a high degree of intelligence and has never suffered from disease of any kind. He convinces Decker not to do a story or Christopher's life will be ruined. Before leaving, Decker assumes out loud that Goodman named the child ""Christopher"" because of Jesus Christ, of whom he was cloned; but the professor rapidly corrects him, claiming that he named him in name of Christopher Colombus, since he believed that the child would usher the world into a new era. Several years later, Decker visits Israel on business and stays with old friends, Joshua and Ilyana Rosen. There he learns lots of things about the historical place and its notable culture. During his visit, Decker receives an anonymous phone call saying that ""Dogs will cry, but their tears will find no place to land"" following the shootings of several Palestinians by Israeli troops in a riot. He immediately calls the police and they tell him that the call must have come from Muslim terrorists, making a threat of some kind of massacre or attack against the Jews (to which the callers referred to as ""the dogs""), but they remain uncertain about where they plan to attack. Decker realizes that the terrorists who called him were referring to The Wailing Wall when they said that the Jews tears would have ""no place to land"". He rushes to the historical site, just in time to watch it blow up entirely. He saves a young boy from being killed by the blast. In retaliation for the destruction of The Western Wall, Israel destroys the Dome of the Rock and retake the Temple Mount. Decker later goes to check on the boy, but he is kidnapped by terrorists, along with his companion journalist and long time friend and confidant, Tom Donafin. They are held captive in an unknown building in Lebanon. He and Tom remain imprisoned for three years. Decker and Tome escape, after one day Decker had a dream of Christopher Goodman, who leads him to the exit. In the dream his captors are dispatched and lie throughout the building. Decker reminds the Dream Christopher that Tom was also held prisoner, and Christopher absent-mindedly shows Decker where he is. Upon waking Decker discovers that his door is unlocked and his captures were dispatched in the same fashion as in his dream, and Tom was right where Christopher had shown him. Decker and Tom then make their escape into the countryside where they are rescued by United Nations troops under none other than the Secretary General, Jon Hansen, with whom Decker forms an instant friendship and bond. They are housed temporarily in Israel, which is under attack by Russians, until it is safe for them to fly home. Transport is arranged for them to get out of the besieged city, however a dog-fight in progress causes Tom and Decker to exit the car to document the duel and Tom tries to get pictures. The car, the driver and Tom are hit by a blast from one of the fighter planes. Decker survives, and Tom is assumed dead. It is revealed the Tom, however does not die. He is stricken blind, however, from the explosion and from flying glass. Decker is informed that Tom's body was never found and he is presumed dead. Decker is finally reunited with his family, and they return to the United States while Decker recovers from captivity. During his recovery period, there is a worldwide catastrophe that seemingly has no explanation. Millions of people wake up next to dead loved ones, and often whole families have died. This event is called ""The Disaster"" by most people, however sudden converts to Christianity begin to call it The Rapture. Decker's entire family, along with his friends abroad, The Rosens, perish in the tragedy. Some collateral damage was also suffered, as people driving cars suddenly die and continue out of control, as well as some commercial airline pilots and others. Decker buries his family, and then falls into a catatonic stupor as the weight of his loss consumes him. Later Christopher Goodman arrives at Decker's house explaining that his adoptive parents died in a plane crash piloted by a casualty of the Disaster. Decker shakes off his catatonia and invites Christopher to stay with him, and Christopher becomes his new family. Jon Hansen offers Decker a position as his assistant at the United Nations, where Christopher encounters Robert Milner, a retired Secretary General who is heavily involved in occult practices, and recognizes Christopher as one who has been prophesied in New Age Councils to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity and enhanced consciousness for mankind. Alice Bernley (a thinly veiled reference to Alice Bailey - an actual noted Theosophist), a confidant of Milner's also sees and recognizes Christopher and they befriend him, and Milner assumes the role of Mentor to Christopher, not only in politics, but in a worldwide New Age movement. Meanwhile, Jon Hansen has been working on an ambitious project to reorganize the United Nations to better handle operations, and in light of the recent Disaster (The Rapture), he has almost open reign to do what he sees necessary. The UN is restructured with a central government led by the Secretary General, and ten Regional Divisions which include Oceania and Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, the Americas, etc. Each of these regions is led by a Primary Regent who is backed up by an Alternate who serves as proxy when the Primary is absent. Israel is the only nation on earth that refuses to join the UN. They refuse to join because their regional partners are all Arab nations that will force them into a position that is extremely unfavorable and lacking represenation within the UN. Meanwhile, Christian Fundamentalists, citing various prophecies in the Biblical Book of Revelation, identify Hansen as the Antichrist or ""The Beast"". This, however, quickly ends as Jon Hansen tragically dies when his helicopter crashes in Pakistan during a fact finding mission. The Office of Secretary General falls vacant, and remains vacant. None of the Ten Regents believe there was anyone to be a suitable replacement for the extremely charismatic, popular and altruistic Hansen. A rotation schedule is established where each Primary Regent serves as Acting Secretary General for a month. It is deemed that this cycle will continue until a unanimous agreement can be made for Hansen's replacement. Unanimous consent is proven to be almost impossible. Years pass, and Christopher has been elected as the European Alternate Regent. Under the tutelage of Milner and Bailey Christopher has embraced his spiritual nature, as well as Decker who has provided him with pragmatic and political guidance. Under machinations of Milner and with the cooperation of various groups such as Freemasons and the Knights Templar with the funding from an occult clearinghouse known as The Lucius Trust (a thinly veiled reference to The Lucis Trust), Christopher comes into possession of The Ark of the Covenant. He gives the Ark to Israel as a gift. and in exchange he wants Israel to sign a treaty with the UN. A seven year treaty is signed promising Israel that they will not be impeded by their neighbors, and UN recognizes their right to exist. When it is proven that the Ark is authentic - proven as Alice Bernley dies from looking inside - Israel agrees, joins the United Nations, and The Ark is placed in the New Temple that was built on the Temple Mount (previously retaken by Israel after the destruction of The Wailing Wall). Albert Faure (renamed to Albert Moore in later printings), an extremely aggressive and deft manipulator - as well as the Primary Regent of Europe - sets in motion a plan that he hopes will gain him the position of Secretary General. Meanwhile, Christopher, following a Spirit guide sets off into the desert for guidance after a series of extremely unsettling dreams about God and an impending feeling of global doom. When Christophers journey into the desert nears its completion (after 40 days and 40 nights), Milner leads Decker to the desert where he says they will encounter Christopher who will need their assistance. Christopher's ""vision quest"" has revealed Faure's plan to him, and he intends to stop it. However they learn that Christopher is too late, because Faure's plan has already culminated in several strategic assassinations, as well as the declaration and execution of the China-India-Pakistan war, a nuclear conflict that lasts a single day, yet ends with hundreds of millions of casualties. No clear winner was declared or recognized in this war, however Moore uses incident to catapult himself into a position of power, at which time he forces a vote for Secretary General. He expects unanimous consent due to bribery, force, blackmail and threats against the other Regents, and he is widely expected to win. Just as the vote for Secretary General is under way, Christopher shows up at the United Nations and announces that Faure was responsible for the assassinations and is the single man who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions in the China-India-Pakistan war. Faure denies this, but Christopher insists, and commands Faure to confess. Seemingly under the power of Christopher Goodman, Faure does confess, and then immediately drops dead in front of every one at the United Nations. It is concluded that Faure died under the weight of his own guilt, but Decker and Robert Milner realize that Christopher has extraordinary powers and he was beginning to exercise them.

The Ghost," The greater part of the action is on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where Lang has been holed up in the holiday home of his billionaire American publisher in order to turn out his memoirs on a deadline. Other scenes are set in Notting Hill, New York and Whitehall. Lang's former press aide Mike McAra has been struggling to ghost his master's memoirs but, as the novel opens, McAra drowns when he apparently falls off the Woods Hole ferry. The fictional narrator of The Ghost, whose name is never revealed, is hired to replace him (his girlfriend walks out on him over his willingness to take the job: ""She felt personally betrayed by him; she used to be a party member.""). He soon suspects foul play and stumbles across evidence of possible motive, buried in Lang's Cambridge past. Having located what may be the lethal secret, the replacement ghostwriter begins to fear for his own safety. Meanwhile Lang, like his real-life counterpart, has been accused by his enemies of war crimes. A leaked memorandum has revealed that he secretly approved the transfer of UK citizens to Guantanamo Bay to face interrogation and possible torture. One Richard Rycart, Lang's disillusioned and renegade former foreign secretary (loosely based on Robin Cook), who before and during his early days in office made much of his wish to adopt an ""ethical"" foreign policy, is now at the UN, in a position to do his former boss serious damage. Unlike Blair, Lang thus appears in imminent threat of indictment at the International Criminal Court. The narrator tussles to reconcile his obligation to complete the ghosting job with its attendant abundant payment on the one hand and, on the other, the pressing need, as he sees it, to reveal Lang's true allegiances. The action really heats up when he contacts Rycart. The narrator comes under increasing jeopardy: romantically and politically, as well as physically.
","The Ghost. BY WM. D. O'CONNOR. WITH TWO ILLUSTRATIONS BY NAST. NEW YORK: G. P. PUTNAM & SON, 661 BROADWAY . At the West End of Boston is a quarter of some fifty streets, more or less, commonly known as Beacon Hill . It is an old street--quaint, quiet, and somewhat picturesque . Rumor told it in a whisper, many years ago, that a ghost was seen there one bitter Christmas eve . The twilight was already in the street; but the evening lamps were not yet lighted in the windows . It was light enough, however, for one to read, easily, from the opposite sidewalk, ""Dr. C. Renton,"" in black letters . The wind swept upon him, and agitation began on the part of the phantom . It glided rapidly to and fro, and moved in circles, and then, with the same swift, silent motion, sailed toward him, as if blown thither by the gale . When he rushed by, it made a futile effort to grasp the swinging arms with which he appeared to buffet back the buffeting gale, darkened slowly, till the form was only a Dr. Renton lit a whole tier of black coals with a series of little explosions, before it could cool down . The fire was now burning in despite of itself, fanned by the wintry gusts, which found their way down the chimney . He stood with his back to it, his hands behind him, his bold white forehead shaded by a careless lock of black hair, and knit sternly . ""Pa in the sulks to-night?"" she asked, in the most winning, playful, silvery voice . ""It's a horrid shame, so it is! Papa-sy, dear,"" she said, and kissed her again . Dr. Renton sat down in the easy-chair, and took her fondly on his knee . The wan ghost in the corner lifted its head to look at her . ""No, no, pa-sy; that won't do. I want the particulars,"" says Netty . ""I've been speculating in railroad stock, and singed my fingers,"" says Renton's piquant rejoinder . The Whigs are in ruinous good health, and the grass is growing in the graveyards . ""I wouldn't let my houses to such people. It's not right; is it? Why, it's horrid to think of men getting drunk, and killing each other!"" Dr. Renton rubbed his hair into disorder, with vexation, and then subsided into solemnity . ""I'm afraid it’s not a good thing for you,"" said Netty, a little tremulously . ""I haven't thought of him for so long a time, and to-day--especially this evening--I have felt as if he were constantly near me,"" he said . ""Pa, dear, if I were you, I'd turn out that rumseller, and swindle some one else?"" he drew from her pocket an old letter, faded to a pale yellow, and gave it to him . ""How did he die, father?"" the stern voice had saddened, and was almost tremulous . The spectral form was still, but the features had become undefined . Pegasus was a genius--that is, a person without an atom of practical talent, he says . ""Dear father, this was very sad. Did you say he died of want?"" ""Of want, my child, of hunger and cold. I don't doubt it. He had wandered about, as I gather, houseless for a couple of days and nights . I found him lying in the street, drenched and burning with fever . It appears that he had always cherished a strange affection for me, though I had grown away from him . ""Your friendship was dear to me. I give you true love. Stocks and returns. You are rich, but I did not wish to be your bounty's pauper,"" says Nathalie . ""I wanted to do the world good and the world has killed me, Charles."" ""It belongs to the psychology of madness. To me, who knew him, there are gleams of sense in it,"" he replied sombrely . ""The world wasn't the place for him,"" says Nathalie . ""I felt, while you were reading the letter, as if he were near us,"" he says . a pale, thin, rigid, frozen-looking little woman faintly said, ""Good evening, ma'am"" ""I'm not cold,"" remarked Dr. Renton, in his hard way . ""I am very sorry, sir, to have made you wait, but we have been unfortunate,"" says Dr. Renton . ""They have to bear it, and they get used to it,"" says Netty . Netty's mother says she'll have no nonsense carried on here, he says . ""I have no wish to question the truth of any statement you may make; but I must tell you plainly, that I can't afford to let my houses for nothing,"" says Dr. Renton . ""People who will not pay me my rent must not live in my tenements. You must move out. I have no more to say,"" the phantom resumes . The fury burst out on his face in a red and angry glow . The phantom stood before him, like a dark cloud in the image of a man . But its darkness was lightening slowly, and its ghostly anger had passed away . The poor woman, paler than before, had sat mute and trembling, with all her hopes ruined . George Feval was tortured by savage pleasure at what at once seemed success, took possession of him . In a moment, he heard the controlled and even voice of Mrs. Renton . It flashed on him at once, that his tenant's husband was the servant of a family like this fellow . Dr. Renton lay down again, but not to repose . Things he had forgotten of his dead friend, now started up again in remembrance . It was vague and sweet and wandering at first, straying on into a strain more mysterious and melancholy, but very shadowy and subdued, and evoking the innocent and tender moods of early youth . It swelled, gathering and sounding on into yet mightier pathos, till all at once it darkened and spread wide in wild despair . The music rose again, a pensive and holy chant, and sounded on to its close, unaffected by the action of his brain, for he slept and heard it no more . At last it rose and glided to the table, on which lay the open letter . It seemed to try to lift the sheets with its misty The ghost, invisible, still watched him. Yes--only a dream; but, how vivid--how strange! With a slow thrill creeping through his veins, the blood curdling at his heart, he stared through the dimness of the room . He strode forward, and turned up the flames of the chandelier . The last page lay upward, and every word of the solemn counsel at the end seemed to dilate on the paper, and all its mighty meaning rushed upon his It was difficult to reach through memory to the crazy chaos of his mind on that night . he must walk quickly, and baffle its pursuit by turning sharp corners, and plunging into devious streets and crooked lanes, and so lose it . At once he was possessed with the conviction that the furtive thing behind, was quickening its movement, and coming up to seize him . Driven from his house in horror, through street and lane, over half the city-driven--hunted in terror, and smitten by a shock here! Driven-driven! He could not rid his mind of the word, nor of the meaning it suggested, and was now singing and howling homeward . The word brought up the name and the thought of his dead friend . In that moment he felt himself a wretched and most guilty man . Before him was the dram-shop, let and licensed to nourish the worst and most brutal appetites and instincts . ""You needn't go, Mr. Flanagan. I'll see to the child,"" says Dr. Renton . ""I'm afraid she's in bed,"" he says . Then, he stepped slowly up the stairs, followed by the bewildered flanagan . ""Mrs. Miller,"" in a low, husky voice, glancing at her frightened face . ""I have no ill-feeling for you, sir, and I know you were hurt and vexed,"" she said . Dr. Renton said, ""you must take it back. You know it was you sent me nothing"" ""I hope, Mrs. Miller, you will not refuse any assistance I can render to your child,"" he said . Mrs. Flanagan sat there in stupefaction, with her apron over her head and face . He then asked if there was any one that could go out to the apothecary's . ""She must be kept cool and quiet, you know, and she'll be all right soon"" ""Mrs. Miller, I haven't done right by you--I know it!"" he broke in, with his face all aglow . ""I am ashamed of myself. This shall be remedied,"" he said . Mrs. Flanagan said she had a strange man at the door for Mrs. Miller . ""Why, Mrs. Miller,"" he replied, ""it must be some one you know, or that knows your circumstances"" there was a good deal done, and a great burden lifted off an humble heart, he murmured . ""I'm very glad some one did his duty by you in your hour of need, though I'm sorry it was not myself,"" she said . astonishment overspreads Mrs. Flanagan's face . ""Please, sir, _do_ hear me! You are very good--but I can't allow you to--Dr. Renton, we are able to pay you the rent, and we _will_--here--now. This shan't be. Come, come, you must take it back. Good heavens!"" he jerked back the letter from his a ""Good night, Mrs. Miller. I'll be here in the morning. Good night,"" he turned around . Mrs. Flanagan drew one of the tens, and gave it to her . ""A-w, docther, dawn't noo,"" she said, ""and now unlock the door."" Oyster-openers and waiters--three of them in all--nearly done for the night . ""Mr. Rollins, this is a serious matter; what are you going to do about it?"" Dr. Renton says . ""Mr. Rollins, the case is this: if you didn't sell liquor here, you'd have no murder done in your place,"" he says . ""I will not be responsible for the outrages that are perpetrated in my building any more,"" says ""good-night"" ""I'm sorry I can't make you go before that. You must quit these premises when your lease expires,"" says Dr. Renton . ""James, my daughter gave you an undirected letter this evening"" ""I wouldn't do it, sir,"" he stammered, after some hesitation . ""You'll do it James, you've got a family--a wife and children--hav'n't you?"" ""I'm going to raise your wages--to-morrow,"" says Dr. Renton . He slept until the gray dawn of Christmas day stole into the room . ""Darling, what is it? Why are you here?"" she knelt by him, burying her awe-struck face in his bosom, and gazed on him . ""Father, dear father!""--he had risen, and sat upon the couch, but then I dreamed of you tearing it to pieces, and trampling on it . But you were lying here so quietly, with your eyes open, and so strange a light on your ""I will not tear the letter to pieces and trample it under foot,"" she clung to him, sobbing violently, her face buried in his hands . ""My child, I know your meaning. God forgive me my life's slight to those words,"" she started, and looked into his face steadfastly . The bright scarlet shot again into her face, but with an April shower of tears, and the rainbow of a smile .

The Secret Sharer," *Nameless Captain (Narrator) *Leggatt *Captain Archbold (Skipper of the Sephora) *The Second Mate *The Chief Mate *The Steward ---- The story takes place at sea, near the Gulf of Siam, and is told from the perspective of a young nameless Captain. The captain is unfamiliar with both his ship and his crew, having only joined their company a fortnight earlier. The Captain is furthermore unsure of himself, questioning his ability to fulfill the role of such an authoritative figure. These themes are explored through symbols throughout the novella. The captain soon encounters a naked swimmer holding onto the side ladder of the ship while he is alone at night on look-out duty. He helps the mysterious swimmer onto the boat and hides him in his cabin without the rest of the crew's knowledge. He then learns of the mysterious swimmer's past; his name is Leggatt, and he swam away from a nearby ship, called the Sephora, where, as chief mate, he killed another crew member for insolence during a storm. The captain keeps Leggatt hidden in his quarters, away from the suspicious crew members and a visit from the skipper of the Sephora. Eventually the Captain allows Leggatt to escape by bringing the ship perilously close to land for Leggatt to swim away safely, though this risky sailing maneuver nearly sends the ship into the rocks, testing the Captain's seamanship. He succeeds and leads the ship away.

I felt most was my being a stranger to the ship; and I was willing to take the adequacy of the others for granted . It was not my part to encourage sneering on board my ship . a scorpion he had found in his cabin a week before slipped out of the cabin . The mate observed regretfully that he ""could not account for that young fellow’s whims"" I detained him as he was making a move . I had hardly seen the ship yet properly . I paced the waist, picturing to myself the coming passage through the Malay Archipelago, down the Indian Ocean, and up the Atlantic . Everybody at the after end of the ship was sleeping profoundly . I was so astounded by the immovableness of that ladder that I remained stock-still, trying to account for it to myself like that imbecile mate of mine . I climbed on the spare spar and leaned over the rail as far as I could, to bring my eyes nearer to that mystery floating alongside . The moment of vain exclamations was past, too . a mysterious communication was established between us two--in the face of that silent, darkened tropical sea . I was young enough to make no comment . In a moment he concealed his damp body in a sleeping suit of the same gray-stripe pattern . a man thinking hard in solitude might wear a sleeping suit . He paused and corrected himself . ""I am the mate of her,"" he said, confidently . It was a miracle that they found us, jammed together behind the forebitts . It seems they rushed us aft together, gripped as we were, screaming ‘Murder!’ like a lot of lunatics, and broke into the cuddy . I understand that the skipper started raving like the rest of them . ""Bless my soul--you don’t say so"" were to put his head up the companion and catch sight of us . The strange captain had a quiet confabulation by the wheel with his own gray ghost . ""You had better slip down into my stateroom now,"" I said, moving off stealthily . ""Nobody is likely to come in here without knocking and getting permission,"" he nodded . He had been kept under arrest in his cabin for nearly seven weeks . But he was not a bit like me, really; yet anyone bold enough to open it stealthily would have been treated to the uncanny sight of a double captain busy talking in whispers . No chief mate ever made more than one voyage in the Sephora, you know . Devil only knows what the law would do to him--of his wife, perhaps . The ‘brand of Cain’ business, don’t you see. That’s all right. I was ready enough to go off wandering on the face of the earth . I sat down on a stone and began to think . I felt certain they would start searching for me at daylight . But now I was clear of that ship, I was not going back . Let them think what they liked, but I didn’t mean to drown myself . I had been appointed to take charge while I least expected anything of the sort . Hadn’t had the time in port to look about me or size anybody up . I felt that it would take very little to make me a suspect person in the eyes of the ship’s company . I was extremely tired, in a peculiarly intimate way, by the strain of stealthiness . I sat there, fagged out, looking at the curtains, trying to clear my mind of the confused sensation of being in two places at once . It was a relief to discover suddenly that it was not in my head at all, but on the outside of the door . I saw the chief mate in long India-rubber boots, near the break of the poop . I watched him coming with a smile which took effect and froze his whiskers . At breakfast time, I presided with such frigid dignity that the two mates were only too glad to escape from the cabin . I listened to the steward going into the bathroom out of the saloon, filling the water bottles there, scrubbing the bath, setting things to rights, whisk, bang, clatter--out again into the recessed part . I saw him sitting rigidly on the low stool, his bare feet close together, his arms folded, his head hanging on his breast--and perfectly still . II The skipper of the Sephora had a thin red whisker all round his face, ""What was the cause of it--some disease?"" he asked, without the least sympathy and as if he thought that, if so, I’d got no more than I deserved . It was just over two months since all this had happened, and he had never heard of such a thing happening in an English ship . ""Good God!” he uttered, impressively, in the manner of a criminal making a reluctant and doleful confession . ""No man killed by the sea ever looked like that,"" he said . ""I was very anxious to give up your mate to the shore people, I believe?"" he replied casually . I didn't engage that young fellow . ""I suppose I must report a suicide,"" I assented, dispassionately . ""Unless you manage to recover him before tomorrow,"" I mumbled . I turned my ear to him in a puzzled manner, ""I mean, alive"" I had been too frightened not to feel vengeful; I felt I had him on the run . My polite insistence must have had something menacing in it, because he gave in suddenly . When at last I showed him out on the quarter-deck he drew a long, spiritless sigh . I suppose he drowned himself, but with his double down there it was almost as trying to be below . There was no one in the whole ship whom I dared take into my confidence . The trust in Providence was denied to his guilt . The bo’s’n perhaps? Perhaps! It wasn’t a heavy sea--it was a sea gone mad! I suppose the end of the world will be something like that; and a man may have the heart to see it coming once and be done with it--but to have to face it day after day--I don’t blame anybody . The same strung-up force which had given twenty-four men a chance, at least, for their lives, had crushed an unworthy mutin A certain order should spring on to his lips without thinking; a certain sign should get itself made, so to speak, without reflection . I felt that I was appearing an irresolute commander to those who were watching me more or less critically . At the sound of my voice he nearly jumped out of his skin, and incidentally broke a cup . the steward, to abhor the voice of that harmless man, came down again . The fourth day out, I say, of this miserable juggling with the unavoidable . This was the sort of thing that made my terrifically whiskered mate tap his forehead with his forefinger . I had detected him using that gesture while talking on deck with a confidential air . The ship was coming round slowly, shut the door, lighted the lamp, and for a time dared not turn round . It was like being haunted. It would not be true to say I had a shock, but an irresistible doubt of his bodily existence flitted through my mind . In the moment of profound silence which follows upon the hands going to their stations I heard his raised voice: “Hard alee!” ""You must maroon me as soon as ever you can get amongst these islands off the Cambodge shore,"" I protested . ""You don’t suppose I am afraid of what can be done to me? Prison or gallows or whatever they may please,"" he said . The Last Day is not yet--and... you have understood thoroughly. Didn’t you? I felt suddenly ashamed of myself . The east side of the gulf is fringed with islands, some solitary, others in groups . On the blue background of the high coast they seem to float on silvery patches of calm water, arid and gray, or dark green and rounded like clumps of evergreen bushes . The manner of life they harbor is an unsolved secret . Koh-ring looked thoughtfully at the chart as if surveying chances and distances from a lofty height . He followed with his eyes his own figure wandering on the blank land of Cochin-China . I had been so worried and restless running up and down that I had not had the patience to dress that day . smuggle the sails out of here into the sail locker, which communicates with the lobby . When the ship’s way is deadened in stays you will have a clear road to slip out and get overboard through the open quarter-deck port . Use a rope’s end to lower yourself into the water so as to avoid a splash . I snatched off my floppy hat and tried hurriedly in the dark to ram it on my other self . I walked over to leeward and my heart flew into my mouth at the nearness of the land on the bow . It was now a matter of conscience to shave the land as close as possible, for now he must go overboard whenever the ship was put in stays . I saw the vague figures of the watch grouped in the waist, gazing in awed silence . I ignored it. I had to go on. “Keep her full. Don’t check her way. That won’t do now,” the helmsman answered me . Then stillness again, with the great shadow gliding closer, towering higher, without a light . I forgot the secret stranger ready to depart, and remembered only that I was a total stranger to the ship . I stepped to the side swiftly, and on the shadowy water I could see nothing except a faint phosphorescent flash revealing the glassy smoothness of the sleeping surface . Now I had what I wanted--the saving mark for my eyes . It was saving the ship, by serving me for a mark to help out the ignorance of my strangeness .

The Pirate," Mr Mertoun and his son had arrived as strangers, and resided for several years in the remaining rooms of the old mansion of the Earls of Orkney, the father leading a very secluded life, while the son Mordaunt became a general favourite with the inhabitants, and especially with the udaller, Magnus Troil, and his daughters. On his way home from a visit to them, he and the pedlar Snailsfoot sought shelter from a storm at the Yellowleys' farmhouse, where they were amused with their penurious ways, and encountered Norna, a relative of Magnus Troil who was supposed to be in league with the fairies, and to possess supernatural powers. The next day a ship was wrecked on the rocky coast, and, at the risk of his life, Mordaunt rescued the captain, Cleveland, as he was cast on the beach clinging to a plank, while Norna prevented his sea-chest from being pillaged. Cleveland was in fact a pirate, but they did not know this. The captain promised his preserver a trip in a consort ship which he expected would arrive shortly, and went to seek the udaller's help in recovering some of his other property that had been washed ashore. After the lapse of several weeks, however, during which the Troils had discontinued their friendly communications with him, Mordaunt heard that the stranger was still their guest, and that they were arranging an entertainment for St John's Eve, to which he had not been bidden. As he was brooding over this slight, Norna touched his shoulder, and, assuring him of her goodwill, advised him to join the party uninvited. Warned by his father against falling in love, and with some misgivings as to his reception, he called at Harfra on his way, and accompanied Yellowley and his sister to the feast. Minna and Brenda Troil replied to their discarded companion's greeting with cold civility, and he felt convinced that Captain Cleveland had supplanted him in their esteem. The bard, Claud Halcro, endeavoured to cheer him with his poetry and reminiscences of John Dryden; and, in the course of the evening, Brenda, disguised as a masquer, told him they had heard that he had spoken unkindly of them, but that she did not believe he had done so. She also expressed her fear that the stranger had won Minna's love, and begged Mordaunt to discover all he could respecting him. During an attempt to capture a whale the following day, Cleveland saved Mordaunt from drowning, and, being thus released from his obligation to him, intimated that henceforth they were rivals. The same evening the pedlar brought tidings that a strange ship had arrived at Kirkwall, and Cleveland talked of a trip thither to ascertain whether it was the consort he had been so long expecting. After the sisters had retired to bed, Norna appeared in their room, and narrated a startling tale of her early life, which led Minna to confess her attachment to the captain, and to elicit Brenda's partiality for Mordaunt. At a secret interview the next morning, Cleveland admitted to Minna that he was a pirate, upon which she declared that she could only still love him as a penitent, and not as the hero she had hitherto imagined him to be. He announced, in the presence of her father and sister, his intention of starting at once for Kirkwall; but at night he serenaded her, and then, after hearing a struggle and a groan, she saw the shadow of a figure disappearing with another on his shoulders. Overcome with grief and suspense, she was seized with a fit of melancholy, for the cure of which the udaller consulted Norna in her secluded dwelling; and, after a mystic ceremony, she predicted that the cause would cease when ""crimson foot met crimson hand"" in the Martyr's Aisle in Orkney land, whither she commanded her kinsman to proceed with his daughters. Mordaunt had been stabbed by the pirate, but had been carried away by Norna to Hoy, where she told him she was his mother, and, after curing his wound, conveyed him to Kirkwall. Here Cleveland had joined his companions, and, having been chosen captain of the consort ship, he obtained leave from the provost for her to take in stores at Stromness and quit the islands, on condition that he remained as a hostage for the crew's behaviour. On their way they captured the brig containing the Troils, but Minna and Brenda were sent safely ashore by John Bunce, Cleveland's lieutenant, and escorted by old Halcro to visit a relative. The lovers met in the cathedral of St Magnus, whence, with Norna's aid, Cleveland escaped to his ship, and the sisters were transferred to the residence of the bard's cousin, where their father joined them, and found Mordaunt in charge of a party of dependents for their protection. When all was ready for sailing, the captain resolved to see Minna once more, and having sent a note begging her to meet him at the Standing Stones of Stenness at daybreak, he made his way thither. Brenda persuaded Mordaunt to allow her sister to keep the appointment, and as the lovers were taking their last farewell, they and Brenda were seized by Bunce and his crew from the boat, and would have been carried off, had not Mordaunt hastened to the rescue, and made prisoners of the pirate and his lieutenant. Norna had warned Cleveland against delaying his departure, and his last hopes were quenched when, from the window of the room in which he and Bunce were confined, they witnessed the arrival of the Halcyon, whose captain she had communicated with, and the capture, after a desperate resistance, of their ship. The elder Mertoun now sought Norna's aid to save their son, who, he declared, was not Mordaunt, as she imagined, but Cleveland, whom he had trained as a pirate under his own real name of Vaughan, her former lover; and having lost trace of him till now, had come to Jarlshof, with his child by a Spanish wife, to atone for the misdeeds of his youth. On inquiry it appeared that Cleveland and Bunce had earned their pardon by acts of mercy in their piratical career, and were allowed to enter the king's service. Minna was further consoled by a penitent letter from her lover; Brenda became Mordaunt's wife; and the aberration of mind, occasioned by remorse at having caused her father's death, having died, Norna abandoned her supernatural pretensions and peculiar habits, and resumed her family name.

""I will ask a few questions of this reverend father,"" he said . Francisco The pirates appeared to side with Francisco, though none of them dared to speak . At this moment the interest of the scene was heightened . ""Filippo! Filippo!"" screamed the girl ""You have your choice; there is a God, an avenging God,"" says the bishop . ""Touch him not! if you are men,"" cried the pirate-captain . Cain and Hawkhurst, with their disappointed crew, returned on board the schooner . The indignation and rage expressed by the captain as he rapidly walked the deck in company with his first ""I know I murdered thee--plead not, he dies!"" cried Cain, still sleeping .

For now the water was borne up upon the strong wings of the hurricane, and the sand was rendered The effect of the blow he had received on his forehead, with the shock of mind occasioned by the disappearance of the boat, overpowered him .

As the seas washed the apparently inanimate the Africans appeared to recover fast by the heat of the sun, so oppressive to Francisco, and were now exchanging a few words with each other . Francisco returned to the knoll, and pouring out water the negroes who had been saved were all huddled up together, apparently in deep sleep, and Francisco quitted his elevated position and walked down to the low beach, to survey the means which the Francisco and the negroes worked willingly, and showed much intelligence . At length it was accomplished; and on the fifth day, they embarked . They were at last able to hoist their Francisco felt convinced that the schooner was the _Avenger_; and his first impulse was to run to the sweep with which they were steered, and put the head of the raft again to Don Cumanos had sailed from Carthagena, South America, to Lisbon .

""I know every timber and plank in her; there is not a rope nor a block but ""I trust I shall prove myself worthy of your confidence, sir,"" says Francisco . ""We might all have been murdered in our beds,"" exclaimed the old don . Francisco sent for the head men of the establishment, ""Let them come, senor; we will give them a warm reception,"" says Francisco, the second in authority . ""If the same captain commands them who did when I was on board of that vessel?"" The boats dashed up the creek, and Francisco hastened back to the house . The pirates were now seen advancing from the out-buildings in strong force . As the Spaniards could not Cain and Hawkhurst had gained the house, and a position under the veranda . At last, the flames wound round them, and their forked tongues licked the balustrade . The Francisco had driven away the assailants from the veranda for a time . But the smoke from below now cleared away, and the discharge of one or two muskets tells Francisco he was Francisco threw his pistol back in the shoulder of his comrades, who had been following him up the ladder . Francisco rushed to attack him; but what was the force of so young a man against the Hawkhurst was badly wounded, and obliged to be carried below as soon as he came on board . The only capture which they had made was their former associate Francisco, who was ordered to be put in irons . Cain's astonishment at the reappearance of Francisco was equally great, and he trembled at the sight of him . ""You have me again, in your power, and ""I was bad, but I was no pirate when your mother lived,"" says Cain . ""I cannot take that hand, it is too deeply dyed in blood,"" says Francisco . Cain, extending his hand ""God bless you, boy! God bless you!"" said Cain, ""but leave me now."" Cain went on deck, and surveyed the vessel through the glass . ""I swear to you I will not, The _Enterprise_ was kept away, and increased her speed: they neared the _Avenger_ more than a quarter of a mile . It was about an hour before dark that The _Enterprise_ tacked and kept close under the frigate's counter . Captain Cain said: ""I have made up my mind to do a bold thing. I will run down to The schooner's foretopsail lay over side, and the _Enterprise_ was completely disabled . Edward Templemore followed the frigate as soon as he could set sail Francisco and Cain imbibed a deadly hatred, and was watching for an opportunity to wreak his revenge . ""You are at liberty again, I see,"" observed Hawkhurst with a sn ""The ship's company wish to know where we are going, sir,"" says Hawkhurst . ""My men! you demand justice, and you shall have it,"" says Cain . He was sentenced to death Francisco stepped forward as the captain of the pirate-captain . ""Take that for your mutiny!"" exclaimed Cain, putting his foot on Hawkhurst's neck . The pirates Clara hurried into the cave, awaiting the arrival of Edward Templemore . The pirate-boat landed at the very spot of rendezvous, and the mate leaped out of the boat . Clar the pirates were unable to get water from the southward until they had passed the Bahama Isles . The frigate was still in sight, although the _Avenger_ dropped her astern . ""This is a pretty business,"" says the admiral to his secretary .

""I have my doubts. But God's will be done!"" says The crew of the pirate-schooner weighed the anchor and continued their precarious course . By noon the wind had considerably increased, and the breakers now turned and broke in wild foam over the coral reefs The men-of-war had seen the _Avenger_ strike on the rocks . The pirates obeyed the orders of the captain . In the first were placed all the wounded men and Clara  Cain was breasting the water manfully, making for a small cove nearer to where the boat was sunk . Cain, anxious for his safety, climbed up the rocks and was watching . Francisco was fast blackening into a corse, and the maiden screamed for pity, and became frantic in her efforts for his rescue . Edward sprang upon Hawk Edward Templemore sprang into Hawkhurst's arms, and was immediately in a state of insensibility . Hawkhurst wished to be assured by her that he was mistaken, and  the captured pirates amounted to nearly sixty, out of which number one-half were those who had surrendered without resistance . The captain of the _Comus_ had orders to return as soon as possible, ""I am more pleased at having secured these scoundrels than if we had taken a French frigate,"" the admiral says .

The word ""Silence!"" from the judge produced an immediate obedience . Francisco continued his address, commencing with the remembrance Edward Templemore: ""I have already said so; and I now repeat it"" he was obliged to point out that many acts in which the prisoner had been involved had endangered his life .

The Golden Road," The plot is based around the character Beverley who remembers his childhood days with his brother Felix and friends and cousins Felicity, Cecily, Dan, Sara Stanley (the ""Story Girl""), hired-boy Peter and neighbor Sara Ray. The children often played in their family's orchard and had many adventures, even creating their own newspaper, called Our Magazine. More character development takes place in this novel than in its predecessor, and the reader is able to watch the children grow up; in particular, they are able to watch Sara Stanley leave the Golden Road of childhood forever. They also are able to see the beginnings of a relationship between Peter and Felicity, as chemistry between them starts to build; it also seems that Beverly and Sara Stanley are drawn to each other, but this is left undeveloped. Throughout the story it is hinted that Beverly's cousin, Cecily, is consumptive; in a passage where the Story Girl tells their futures, the adult Beverly confirms that Cecily never left the Golden Road. As well, she strongly hints that Peter and Felicity will be married. The novel ends after Sara's father collects her to give her a proper education, and their small group is never complete again.

The Hill of Dreams," The novel recounts the life of a young man, Lucian Taylor, focusing on his dreamy childhood in rural Wales, in a town based on Caerleon. The Hill of Dreams of the title is an old Roman fort where Lucian has strange sensual visions, including ones of the town in the time of Roman Britain. Later it describes Lucian's attempts to make a living as an author in London, enduring poverty and suffering in the pursuit of art.

The air was still, breathless, exhausted after heavy rain Lucian went on and on, catching glimpses of the amazing country into which he had penetrated, and perceiving rather than seeing that as the day waned everything Lucian’s father had told him he was the _vallum_ of the camp . On this summit oaks had grown, queer stunted-looking trees with  Lucian was once found guilty of recommending Villon to a school-fellow named Barnes . Barnes tried to extract unpleasantness from the text during preparation, and rioted in It was a queer, funny life that of school, and so very unlike anything in _Tom Brown_ . He once saw the headmaster patting the head of the bishop Lucian the parson, as his parishioners called him, had read the fine books and loved the hills and woods, and now knew no more of pleasant or sensational surprises  the Roman fort, whose steep bastions and haggard oaks he had seen the flames of sunset writhing nearly three years before, had been a desirable place Lucian began to fight his way through the ugly growth, stumbling and getting hard knocks from the rebound of twisted boughs . Beyond the ditch there was an undergrowth he thought of the valley winding far below him, all its fields by the brook green and peaceful and still, without path or track . And behind there were, wild as common, The shadows had changed when he awoke; his senses came to him with a sudden shock . He sat up and stared at his bare limbs Mr. Taylor had seized a nettle with thick folds of his handkerchief, and twisted off a good length, and put it in his pocket to show his father Arthur Dixon was a beastly muff when he missed a catch, rather a difficult catch . At last the game broke up solely from Lucian’s lack of Mr. Taylor was a man of very wide and irregular reading and a tenacious memory . He had once told Mr. Dixon a singular and _drolatique_ Lady Dixon asked Lucian out of charity, and she asked him out of a way . But he is such an _unsatisfactory_ boy, he would only Annie Morgan had grown into a woman in three years, and he was still a boy . She poured out the green oily cider, fragrant of the orchard .

The months went by, monotonous, and sometimes blotted with despair  I. Lucian was growing really anxious about his manuscript . The book had been lying at Messrs. Beit’s office for more than three months . At post-time, _Messrs. Beit & Co.’s Recent Publications . He settled himself comfortably on the seat, lit his pipe, and began to read . Lucian leant back and roared with indecent laughter till the tabby tom-cat who had succeeded to the poor dead beasts looked up reproachfully from his sunny Lucian forgot his old book, and resolved that he would make a better one if he could . At first it seemed he had hit upon a promising subject . Lucian had not yet reached his father’s stage, he was unable to grin in the manner of that irreverent parson . The passage selected for high praise was taken Lucian had heard of these sage counsels, and through it them as he listened to the bitter complaints of the gaunt, hungry old women . The other old sin the great Yahoo nation would surely never feed and encourage a scabby Houyhnhnm, expelled for his foulness from the horse-community, and the Lucian had never deliberately aided in oppression, or looked on it with enjoyment and approval, and was to call this loathsome beast, all sting and filth, Roman trumpet, _tuba mirum spargens sonum_, filling all the hollow valley with its command, reverberated in dark places in the far forest . the great flame sank down to a red glint of fire, and it led him on down the ragged slope, his feet striking against ridges of ground, and ""Good evening, Master Lucian,"" said the girl, ""it’s very dark, sir, indeed."" The thought struck Lucian with a shock; the evening’s passion and The Celt assailed him, becoming from the weird wood he called the world, and his far-off ancestors, the “little people” crept out of their cave _The Chorus in Green_ was duly produced, wrapped in brown paper, with Messrs. Beit’s address label on it, and the post-office dated stamp He was pleased that his father liked his book, because he knew him to be a deep and sober scholar and a cool judge of good letters; but he laughed to himself when Tomson, a playwright who can make his five thousand a year easily, accuses him of petty larceny . ""I think you are mistake Father and son had smiled together at these observations, which were probably true enough .

It was too absurd a woman, one of the hated race, was beside him in the darkness, and the wild beast woke within him, ravening for blood and brutal lust . The ghost Lucian was engaged in composition; he was plainly rapturous, enthusiastic . The parson began to fear that his son was like some mad Frenchmen of whom he had Tennyson's noble gentleman thought of their ladies with something of reticence . they imagined them dressed in courtly robes, walking with slow dignity .

It was, indeed, with something of rapture that he imagined the great procession of years all Lucian was astonished at the enormous change that was thus effected, and often, though he himself had done the work, he could scarcely describe in words how it Lucian had been seven months in London when this odd experience first occurred to him . The day opened dreary and cold and clear, with a gusty and restless wind  Giotto, a painter, had vowed to be the dunce of Cervantes's school rather than top-boy in the academy of _A Bad Un Lucian walked mechanically for the hour, going eastward, along the main road .

It was not until the winter was well advanced that he began at all . he had taken one or two vague walks Lucian had been working steadily for some weeks, well enough satisfied on the whole with the daily progress, but in a few days the great frost set in . The new year opened he was aghast on the discovery of the imbecilities he had committed to paper . Lucian was a journalist on the staff of the _Da Lucian knew that the fire of his torment and anguish must in some way glow visibly about him; he moved, perhaps, in a nimbus that  he was enraptured at the thought of happy hours they promised, but now they were meaningless, faded into grey . When he understood the idea it seemed foolish, Lucian came one day into a lonely and unfrequented byway, a country lane falling into ruin, but still fringed with elms . he Lucian stood still in the road while the woman’s cries grew faint and died away . He remembered nothing of his violent gestures; he had not known that he a man was not necessarily monstrous, merely because he did not appreciate high tea, a quiet chat about the neighbors, and a happy noisy evening with the children . Lucian smelt the dark and frosty earth as he walked beside his mother down the winding lane .

She ran from him screaming, frightened no doubt by what was to her sudden and strange a young fellow was playing the concertina, but there was nothing so strange as the burst of sound that swelled out when the public-house doors were opened  The Bacchic fury unveiled and unashamed in the faces around him . To his eyes it seemed as if they recognized him as a fellow, and smiled up a woman in a brown ulster shuffled off on some errand, then a man in shirt-sleeves poked out his head, On the main road the trams went humming to and fro, and young men who wore bright blue ties cheerfully haw-hawed and smoked penny cigars Lucian had often observed this species of triumph, and noted the acclamation that never failed the clever sham . He thought the art of counterfeiting half-crown phantom play acted on that fiery stage, beneath those brassy lamps, very slowly swinging in a violent blast . It seemed that he had witnessed and acted sound reminded him of the half-forgotten days . He thought of his boyhood, and the old rectory, and great elms that surrounded it .

The noise of the storm without grew louder a woman’s face watched him from between the matted boughs, and she summoned to her side awful companions who had never grown old through all the ages . In these dry days that he lived in, when he had bought, it was pleasant to think of a time when all things were possible, when the most splendid design seemed an affair of he had long known that he would have to be content with a far approach . but in those far days the impossible was but a part of wonderland that lay before him a red cloud seemed to swell over the hill, and grow great, and come near to him . It had almost come to that; the drift and the breath of the scarlet AVE ATQUE VALE The old words sounded in his ears like the ending of a chant . The heaviness of languor still oppressed him, It was strange how in the brick and stucco desert where no trees were, he all the time imagined the noise of tossing boughs, the grinding of the bough he thought of himself walking, as he had often walked, from lamp to lamp on such a night, treasuring his lonely thoughts, and weighing the hard task it was as if the sickening fumes that steamed from the burning bricks had been sublimed into the shape of houses . it appeared to him that vulgarity and The malpassage had become a peaceful winding lane, with warm shelter beneath its banks from the dismal wind .

Somehow the sun does not shine so brightly as it used; the trackless meadows of old time have shrunk and dwindled away to poor acres . A saddening doubt, a dull suspicion, creeps over me . The holiday was for all, the Harold, who invented his own games and played them without assistance, always stuck staunchly to a new fad, till he had worn it quite out . ‘Oh, he’s just playin’ muffin-man, as usual,’ said Charlotte with petulance. ‘And Edward, where is he?’ 'Why, there aren’t any good lions,' said Harold hastily . ‘_I_ should ask Martha,’ said Harold dubiously, then turned to Charlotte . 'No, I won’t, I swear I won't,’ protested Edward . I had no words to describe it, that earth-effluence of which I was conscious . I ran sideways, shouting; I dug glad heels into the squelching soil; I splashed diamond showers from puddles with a stick . The tune was an improvisation, a weary, a hedgehog lay dead athwart the path—nay, more than dead; decadent, distinctly; a sorry sight for one that had known the fellow in more bustling circumstances .

Uncle George's manner at once underwent a complete and contemptible change . His interest in rational topics seemed, ‘like a fountain’s sickening pulse’ to flag and ebb away; and although Miss Smedley’s ostensible purpose was to take Selina for her usual walk, it would Harold had been told off to accompany his relative to the station; and the feeling was unanimous, that, as an uncle, William could not be allowed to pass . When Harold appeared on the scene; his red face, round eyes, and mysterious demeanour, hinting at awful portents . Then he shoved these into my ‘O _please_,’ cried Harold. ‘I’ll be Lancelot!’ . ‘O, but you can’t,’ she cried again. 'I won’t play unless I’m Lancelot.’ ‘O’s here,’ I said . Soldiers were not the common stuff of everyday life . There had been nothing like this since the winter before last, when on a certain afternoon the hounds had burst through the fence with their mellow cry . ‘Of course there is,’ panted Harold, ‘that he’s begun that beastly Latin? 'If they were going to be Indians,' he replied doubtfully. 'Are they charging?' cried Harold, very weary, but rallying gamely . ‘If they try to take us prisoner,’ he said, ‘we’ll run, will we?’ . Harold rushed up to him at once and jumped out with a cheery hail . The doctor looked grave and twisting his face this way and that . There are higher things than truth; and we were almost reconciled, by the time we were put down . In such a matter, girls were worse than useless, as wanting the necessary tenacity of will and contempt for self-constituted authority . The act, with its daring, tinted everything with new strange hues; affecting the individual with a sort of bruised feeling just below the pit of the stomach, that was intens I spied where a rabbit was wont to pass, close down by the water’s edge . I stood inside, safe but breathless at the sight . Here was a malignant contrivance of the Pirates, designed to baffle gun-boats .

In no tranced repose, however, but laughingly, struggling to disengage her hand from the grasp of a grown-up man who occupied the marble bench with her I was sleepy, and assented; but before they left me, the grown-up man put two half-crowns in my hand, for the purpose of treating the other water-babies . I watched them disappear down the path—how naturally arms seem to go round waists in Fairyland!—and then, my Jerry hailed from far Japan: his hair was straight and black, his one garment cotton of a simple blue; and his reputation was distinctly bad . Rosa was typical British, from her flaxen poll to the stout calves she displayed so liberally; and in character she was of the blameless order of those who have Jerry remained passive until Charlotte had got well under way, and then began to heel over quietly in Rosa’s direction . Her head fell on her plump shoulder, causing her to start nervously . ‘O Jerry,’ she cried piteously, ‘if you’re not going to be good, how ever shall I tell you Jerry seemed to hesitate a moment between the bliss of indulgence in sulks with a sense of injury, and the imperious summons of beauty waiting to be wooed at his elbow .

The Black Man had got Jerry at last; and although the tear of sensibility might bedew an eye or two for his lost sake, no one who really knew him I was not big enough to stand up to Edward personally, so I had to console the sufferer by allowing him to grease the wheels of the donkey-cart . Harold was soon all smiles and grease; and I wasn't dissatisfied with the significant hint that had been gained as to the _fons  Aunt Eliza, of all people, turned out to be the _Dea ex machinâ_ . The thing fell out in this wise. It was that lady’s obnoxious practice to issue forth, of a Sunday afternoon, on a visit of state to such farmers and cottagers as dwelt at Sabina's face softened, and her contemptuous nose descended from its altitude of scorn . She gave me one shy glance of kindness, and then concentrated her attention upon Mercy knocking at the Wicket Gate . The evening service was shorter than usual, the vicar, as he ascended the pulpit Edward and I were leaning out of the open window in our nightshirts, watching the play of the cedar-branch shadows on the moonlit lawn, and planning schemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny morrow . The new curate had been bidden to dinner that night, and was at the moment uncler The fellow looked puzzled and said: ‘“What hollow oak? I don’t know any hollow oak.” ‘Perhaps it was the Royal Oak?” said Bobby promptly, ‘cos he saw he had made a slip, through trusting too much to the rotten book; but this didn’t seem to make the fellow Harold climbed deftly down the porch like a white rat, and his night-gown glimmered a moment on the gravel walk ere . A brief interval of silence ensued; broken suddenly by a sound of scuffle, and then a shrill long-drawn sque ‘There, never mind his teeth,’ interrupted the curate rudely . ‘I was in a frightful funk,’ continued the narrator, warily guarding his ear with his hand, ‘but just then the drawing-room window opened, and you and Aunt Maria came out—I mean emerged. A HARVESTING THE year was in its yellowing time, and the face of Nature was a study in old gold . Edward and I, knowing that this particular field was to be carried to-day, were revelling in the privilege of riding in the empty waggons from the rickyard back to the sheaves . I fell back in the attitude every boy under these circumstances instinctively adopts . I found myself facing a tall elderly man, clean-shaven, clad in well-worn black—a clergyman evidently; and I noted at once a far-away look in his eyes, as if they were used to another plane of 'Want to strum?' asked my friend, as if it was the most natural wish in the world . ‘At home I’m not allowed to—only beastly exercises!’ he replied . 'I might have been in Botia, for any consciousness he had of me. 'You think not?' he rejoined doubtfully, getting up and walking about the room . ‘Well, I applaud such fairness and temperance in so young a critic. They are qualities—in youth—as rare as they are pleasing. But just look at Schrumpffius, for instance— Edward, accustomed, as the youngest, was violently stage-struck on this his first introduction to the real Drama, was striding up and down the floor, proclaiming ‘Here be I, King Gearge the Third,’ in a strong Berkshire accent . Edward was absorbed in ‘clubmen’: a performance Charlotte and I crouched in the window-seat, watched, spell-stricken, the whirl and eddy and drive of the innumerable snow-flakes, wrapping our cheery little world in an uncanny uniform . ‘Do you mean to say it’s all lies?’ asked Charlotte bluntly 'I know a jolly story,' Edward began. ‘Aunt Eliza told it me. It was when she was somewhere over in that beastly abroad’—(he had once spent a black month of misery at Dinan) 'And the other stork was quite sorry, and moped, and went The Holy Grail itself, ‘sliding athwart a sunbeam,’ never so effectually stilled a riot of warring passions into sweet and quiet accord . As financier, Edward had claimed exemption from any servile duties of procurement, and had swaggered about the garden while I  'I can’t make out what they find to talk about. They never stop; it’s gabble, gabble and gabble right along, like a nest of young rooks,' said Edward . 'What _do_ they talk about, Charlotte?' asked Harold . ‘I don’ Edward aimed a ginger-beer cork at the unruffled beast, who never budged. ‘O but rabbits _do_ talk,’ interposed Harold . ‘I’ve watched them often in their hutch.

We made our way down to the stream, and captured the farmer’s boat without let or hindrance, the enemy being engaged in the  A grey old sun-dial dominated the central sward, and we moved towards it instinctively, as the most human thing in sight . An antick motto ran round it, and with eyes and fingers we struggled at the decipherment .

As we neared home, it gradually occurred to us that perhaps the greatest danger was yet to come; for the farmer must have missed his boat ere now, and would probably be lying in wait for us near the landing-place . The ROMAN ROAD ALL the roads of our neighbourhood were cheerful and friendly, having each of them pleasant qualities of their own; but this one seemed different from the others in its masterful suggestion of a serious purpose . The others tempted chiefly with their treasures of hedge and ditch; the rapt surprise of the first lords From Rome I drifted on to other cities, faintly heard of, but there was a certain sameness in my conception of all of them: that wesleyan chapel would keep cropping up everywhere .

It’s in London,’ said he. ‘I’ve got a large garden The artist laid down his brush. ‘That _would_ be a nice city,’ he said . ‘You can’t do that sort of thing in Rome—or in Piccadilly either.

The Phoenix and the Carpet," This middle volume of the trilogy that began with Five Children and It and concludes with The Story of the Amulet deviates somewhat from the other two because the Psammead gets only a brief mention, and because in this volume the children live with both of their parents and their younger brother—the Lamb—in their home in London. Consequently, there is less loneliness and sense of loss in this volume than in the other two. In both of the other volumes, circumstances have forced the children to spend a protracted period away from their familiar London home and their father; in Amulet, their mother and the Lamb are absent as well. A continuing theme throughout The Phoenix and the Carpet is, appropriately enough, the ancient element of fire. The story begins shortly before November 5, celebrated in England as Guy Fawkes Night. Traditionally, children light bonfires and set off fireworks on this night. The four children have accumulated a small hoard of fireworks but are too impatient to wait until November 5 to light them, so they set off a few samples in the nursery. This results in a fire that destroys the carpet. Their parents purchase a second-hand carpet which, upon arrival, is found to contain an egg that emits a weird phosphorescent glow. The children accidentally knock this egg into the fire: it hatches, revealing a golden Phoenix who speaks perfect English. It develops that this is a magical carpet, which can transport the children to anywhere they wish in the present time, although it is only capable of three wishes per day. Accompanied by the Phoenix, the children have exotic adventures in various climes. There is one moment of terror for the children when their youngest brother, the Lamb, crawls onto the carpet, babbles some incoherent baby talk, and vanishes. Fortunately, the Lamb only desired to be with his mother. At a few points in the novel, the children find themselves in predicaments from which the Phoenix is unable to rescue them by himself; he goes to find the Psammead and has a wish granted for the children's sake. In addition, in the end, the carpet is sent to ask the Psammead to grant the Phoenix's wish. These offstage incidents are the only contribution made by the Psammead to this story. The Phoenix and the Carpet features some intriguing depictions of London during the reign of Edward VII. At one point, the children and their supernatural bird visit the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company: the egotistical Phoenix assumes that this is his modern-day temple, and the insurance executives must be his acolytes. The children also have an encounter with two older ruffians named Herb and Ike who attempt to steal the Phoenix. Possibly the most interesting chapter in this novel occurs when the four children attend a Christmas pantomime at a West End theatre, smuggling the Phoenix along inside Robert's coat. The Phoenix is so excited by this spectacle that he unintentionally sets fire to the theatre. In Edwardian times, many theatres in Britain and the United States were fire-traps, and it was not unusual for a conflagration in a theatre to produce hundreds of deaths. This chapter is vivid and highly convincing, but all ends well when the Phoenix magically reverses the damage: no one is harmed, and the theatre remains intact. One aspect of The Phoenix and the Carpet that is atypical for children's fantasy fiction is the fact that, in this story, the magical companion does not treat all the children equally. The Phoenix insists on favouring Robert- the child who actually put his egg in the fire, albeit by accident- over his brother Cyril and their sisters. This is a mixed privilege, as Robert is lumbered with the duty of smuggling the Phoenix past their parents at inconvenient moments. In the novel's final chapter, the Phoenix announces that he has reached the end of his current lifespan and must begin the cycle again (apparently on the grounds that life with the children has left him far more exhausted than he would have been in the wilderness.) He lays a new egg from which he will eventually be reborn. Under the Phoenix's direction, the children prepare an altar with sweet incense, upon which the Phoenix immolates himself. The magical carpet has also reached the end of its lifespan, as it was never intended to be walked upon regularly, and, at the request the Phoenix, it takes the egg away to a place where it won't hatch again for 2,000 years. There is a happy ending, with the children receiving a parcel of gifts from an ""unknown benefactor"" (the Phoenix, who arranges this gift by means of a wish granted by the Psammead), and Robert receiving a single golden feather. But the feather has vanished by the evening and it is truly the last of the Phoenix and the Carpet. The last volume in the series, The Story of the Amulet, contains a minor episode in which the children travel thousands of years into the past and encounter the Phoenix, who does not recognise them because, in his linear timeline, the events of the previous book have not happened yet.

Anthea did this because she thought it would be good for the Lamb ‘Couldn’t you tell it us in English?’ asked Anthea, jumping the Lamb on her knee. ‘Oh, come along, do,’ said Robert, holding out his hand ‘Look here,’ said Cyril, in stern desperation, ‘will you go away, and make your pudding in a pie-dish, or a flower-pot, or ‘I’m a little white duck-dickie what swims,’ said Anthea . ‘Let him.

For from that day she was never anything like so disagreeable as she was ‘Where on earth HAVE you been?’ asked Cyril, ‘because you did not look in the place where I was. Confess that that hallowed spot was overlooked by you’ . Cyril said he was obliged to put in ‘lovely’ to make the line long enough . ‘There’s true politeness,’ said the Phoenix, and the next moment Jane and Anthea scorned to reply, and Cyril and Robert found that they were hardly a match for the rough crowd . They turned a corner sharply, and then Anthea and Jane were as angry as the boys, but it made them want to cry .

It swung up on a creaking, unwilling hinge, and showed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight . Cyril’s and Robert’s handkerchiefs, indeed, seem unnaturally small . The first house they came to was a little white house with green shutters and a slate 'I have not heard an English voice to repeal me the past,' said the lady . ‘It will itself burn--your genteel parrakeet!’ said Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear she should faint for joy, like people in books, and they hugged her with the earnest, joyous hugs of unselfish delight .

'I thought the floor was the proper home of a carpet, ‘Oh, do shut up, for any sake!’ said Cyril, sinking into a chair . ‘Well, what HAS happened?’ said the bird, still rather crossly  The Phoenix rubbed its beak thoughtfully with its claw . ‘You might rescue him,’ it said, ‘and conceal him here, till the law-supporters had forgotten about him’  Cyril threw her arms round the burglar and whispered 'I wish we were in our burglar's lonely cell.' The burglar was chained by heavy fetters to  ‘I’ve always wanted to go on that there trip, but I’ve never ‘ad the ready at the right time of the year,’ said Cyril, well meaning, but inaccurate, ‘Look ‘ere,’ said the burglar, ‘you’re the best-looking fellow I’ve seen this many a day.

The curate, Jane and Robert felt quite ill with helplessness and hopelessness . A really conscientious curate is a very difficult thing to manage .

The Woodlanders," The story takes place in a small woodland village called Little Hintock, and concerns the efforts of an honest woodsman, Giles Winterborne, to marry his childhood sweetheart, Grace Melbury. Although they have been informally betrothed for some time, her father has made financial sacrifices to give his adored only child a superior education and no longer considers Giles good enough for her. When the new doctor &ndash; a well-born and handsome young man named Edred Fitzpiers &ndash; takes an interest in Grace, her father does all he can to make Grace forget Giles, and to encourage what he sees as a brilliant match. Grace has more awe than love for Fitzpiers, but marries him nonetheless. After the honeymoon, the couple take up residence in an unused wing of Melbury's house. Soon, however, Fitzpiers begins an affair with a rich widow named Mrs. Charmond, takes to treating Grace coldly, and finally deserts her one night after he accidentally reveals his true character to his father-in-law. Melbury tries to procure a divorce for his daughter so she can marry Giles after all, but in vain. When Fitzpiers quarrels with Mrs. Charmond and returns to Little Hintock to try to reconcile with his wife, she flees the house and turns to Giles for help. He is still convalescing from a dangerous illness, but nobly allows her to sleep in his hut during stormy weather, whilst he insists on sleeping outside. As a result, he dies. Grace later allows herself to be won back to the at least temporarily repentant Fitzpiers, thus sealing her fate as the wife of an unworthy man. No one is left to mourn Giles except a courageous peasant girl named Marty South, who all along has been the overlooked but perfect mate for him, and who has always loved him.

Sons and Lovers," Part I: The refined daughter of a ""good old burgher family,"" Gertrude Coppard meets a rough-hewn miner at a Christmas dance and falls into a whirlwind romance characterized by physical passion. But soon after her marriage to Walter Morel, she realizes the difficulties of living off his meagre salary in a rented house. The couple fight and drift apart and Walter retreats to the pub after work each day. Gradually, Mrs. Morel's affections shift to her sons beginning with the oldest, William. As a boy, William is so attached to his mother that he doesn't enjoy the fair without her. As he grows older, he defends her against his father's occasional violence. Eventually, he leaves their Nottinghamshire home for a job in London, where he begins to rise up into the middle class. He is engaged, but he detests the girl's superficiality. He dies and Mrs. Morel is heartbroken, but when Paul catches pneumonia she rediscovers her love for her second son. Part II: Both repulsed by and drawn to his mother, Paul is afraid to leave her but wants to go out on his own, and needs to experience love. Gradually, he falls into a relationship with Miriam, a farm girl who attends his church. The two take long walks and have intellectual conversations about books but Paul resists, in part because his mother looks down on her. At Miriam's family's farm, Paul meets Clara Dawes, a young woman with, apparently, feminist sympathies who has separated from her husband, Baxter. Paul leaves Miriam behind as he grows more intimate with Clara, but even she cannot hold him and he returns to his mother. When his mother dies soon after, he is alone. Lawrence summarized the plot in a letter to Edward Garnett on 12 November 1912: :It follows this idea: a woman of character and refinement goes into the lower class, and has no satisfaction in her own life. She has had a passion for her husband, so her children are born of passion, and have heaps of vitality. But as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers &mdash; first the eldest, then the second. These sons are urged into life by their reciprocal love of their mother &mdash; urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives, and holds them. It's rather like Goethe and his mother and Frau von Stein and Christiana &mdash; As soon as the young men come into contact with women, there's a split. William gives his sex to a fribble, and his mother holds his soul. But the split kills him, because he doesn't know where he is. The next son gets a woman who fights for his soul &mdash; fights his mother. The son loves his mother &mdash; all the sons hate and are jealous of the father. The battle goes on between the mother and the girl, with the son as object. The mother gradually proves stronger, because of the ties of blood. The son decides to leave his soul in his mother's hands, and, like his elder brother go for passion. He gets passion. Then the split begins to tell again. But, almost unconsciously, the mother realizes what is the matter, and begins to die. The son casts off his mistress, attends to his mother dying. He is left in the end naked of everything, with the drift towards death.

The Taming of the Shrew," Prior to the first act, an induction frames the play as a ""kind of history"" played in front of a befuddled drunkard named Christopher Sly who is tricked into believing that he is a lord. In the play performed for Sly, the ""Shrew"" is Katherina Minola, the eldest daughter of Baptista Minola, a lord in Padua. Katherina's temper is notorious and it is thought no man would ever wish to marry her. On the other hand, two men – Hortensio and Gremio – are eager to marry her younger sister Bianca. However, Baptista has sworn not to allow his younger daughter to marry before Katherina is wed, much to the despair of her suitors, who agree that they will work together to marry off Katherina so that they will be free to compete for Bianca. The plot becomes more complex when Lucentio, who has recently come to Padua to attend university, sees Bianca and instantly falls in love with her. Lucentio overhears Baptista announce that he is on the lookout for tutors for his daughters, so he has his servant Tranio pretend to be him while he disguises himself as a Latin tutor named Cambio, so that he can woo Bianca behind Baptista's back. In the meantime, Petruchio arrives in Padua, accompanied by his servant, Grumio. Petruchio tells his old friend Hortensio that he has set out to enjoy life after the death of his father and that his main goal is to wed. Hearing this, Hortensio seizes the opportunity to recruit Petruchio as a suitor for Katherina. He also has Petruchio present to Baptista a music tutor named Litio (Hortensio himself in disguise). Thus, Lucentio and Hortensio, pretending to be the teachers Cambio and Litio, attempt to woo Bianca unbeknownst to her father, and to one another. Petruchio, to counter Katherina's shrewish nature, woos her with reverse psychology, pretending that every harsh thing she says or does is kind and gentle. Katherina allows herself to become engaged to Petruchio, and they are married in a farcical ceremony during which (amongst other things) he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine, and then takes her home against her will. Once they are gone, Gremio and Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily outbidding Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than the real Lucentio actually possesses, and Baptista determines that once Lucentio's father confirms the dowry, Bianca and Tranio can marry. Tranio thus decides that they will need someone to pretend to be Vincentio, Lucentio's father, at some point in the near future. Elsewhere, as part of their scheme, Tranio persuades Hortensio that Bianca is not worthy of his attentions, thus removing any problems he may cause. Meanwhile, in Petruchio's house, he begins the ""taming"" of his new wife. She is refused food and clothing because nothing – according to Petruchio – is good enough for her; he claims perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress doesn't fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also sets about disagreeing with everything she says, and forcing her to agree with everything he says, no matter how absurd; on their way back to Padua to attend Bianca's wedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims that ""if you please to call it a rush-candle,/Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me"" (4.5.14–15). Along the way, they meet Vincentio who is also on his way to Padua, and Katherina agrees with Petruchio when he declares that Vincentio is a woman and then apologises to Vincentio when Petruchio tells her he is a man. Meanwhile, back in Padua, Lucentio and Tranio convince a passing pedant to pretend to be Vincentio and confirm the dowry for Bianca. The man does so, and Baptista is happy for Bianca to wed Lucentio (actually Tranio in disguise). Bianca then secretly elopes with the real Lucentio. However, Vincentio arrives in Padua, and encounters the Pedant, who claims to be Lucentio's father. Tranio (still disguised as Lucentio) appears, and the Pedant acknowledges him to be his son Lucentio. There is much confusion about identities, and the real Vincentio is set to be arrested when the real Lucentio appears with his newly betrothed Bianca, and reveals all to a bewildered Baptista and Vincentio. Lucentio explains everything that has happened and all is forgiven by the two fathers. Meanwhile, Hortensio has married a rich widow, and so in the final scene of the play there are three newly married couples at Baptista's banquet; Bianca and Lucentio, the widow and Hortensio, and Katherina and Petruchio. Because of the general opinion that Petruchio is married to a shrew, a quarrel breaks out about whose wife is the most obedient. Petruchio proposes a wager whereby each will send a servant to call for their wives, and whichever comes most obediently will have won the wager for her husband. Katherina is the only one of the three who comes, winning the wager for Petruchio. At the end of the play, after the other two wives have been hauled into the room by Katherina, she gives a speech on the subject of why wives should always obey their husbands and the play ends with Baptista, Hortensio and Lucentio marvelling at how successfully Petruchio has tamed the shrew.

Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed and warm thee . FIRST HUNTSMAN. I will, my lord. LORD. [_Sees Sly SECOND HUNTSMAN. It would seem strange unto him when he wak’d. LORD. Carry him gently to my fairest chamber, And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet . Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose-water and bestrew’d with flowers; Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper; And ask him what apparel he will wear; Another tell him of his hounds and horse, And that his lady mourns at Sly is discovered in a rich nightgown, with Attendants: some with apparel, basin, ewer, and other appurtenances; and Lord, dressed like a servant. SLY. For God’s sake! a pot of small ale. SECOND SERVANT. Will’t please your lordship drink a cup of sack? Sly. I ne’er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, THIRD SERVANT. O! this is it that makes your servants droop. LORD. Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment, And banish hence these abject lowly dreams . Upon my life, I am a lord indeed; And yet she is inferior to none. SLY. Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, Being all this time abandon’d from your bed . PAGE. Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her? SLY . Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough. Where is my wife? PAGE . My wife, who will not call me husband, is your goodman . PAGE.

Sister, content you in my discontent humbly I subscribe: My books and instruments shall be my company . I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold? LUCENTIO. O Tranio, I saw sweet beauty in her face, Such as the daughter of Agenor had, That made great Jove to humble him to her hand, When with his knees he kiss’d the Cretan strand . TRANIO. Nay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance. if you love the  TRANIO. You will be schoolmaster, And undertake the teaching of the maid: That’s your device . LUCENTIO. It is: may it be done?

My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play. SLY. I do. My master is mad. PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me here soundly. GRUMIO. Knock you here, sirrah, and you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it.

Tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona? PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me: Antonio, my father, is deceas’d, And I have thrust myself into this maze, Haply to wive and thrive HORTENSIO. Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is: He hath the jewel of my life in hold, His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca, And her withholds from me and other more, Suitors to her and rivals in my love; Supposing it a thing impossible, For those defects I have before rehears’d, That ever Katherina will be woo’d HORTENSIO. Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love: Listen to me, and that my deeds shall prove. GRUMIO. Upon agreement from us to his liking, Will undertake to woo curst Katherine; Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please. GREMIO. So done, is well. Hortensio. Have you told him all her faults? PETRUCHIO. I know she is HORTENSIO. Sir, let me be so bold as ask you, Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter? TRANIO. If it be so, sir, that you are the man Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest; And let it be more than Alcides’ twelve . GRUMIO, BIONDELLO. O excellent motion! Fellows, let’s be gone . BIANCA.

You are marvellous forward. PETRUCHIO. O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing. GREMIO. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it.

KATHERINA. Then let him that mov’d you hither Remove you hence . Thee, knowing thee to be but young and light, if me you mean. PETR PETRUCHIO. 'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen, And now I find report a very liar; For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous, But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers . O! let me see thee walk: 'thou dost not halt. KATHERINA. A witty mother! witless else her son, I will marry you' 'tis incredible to believe How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on kiss, That in a twink she won me to her love .

Madam, before you touch the instrument, I must begin with rudiments of art . BIANCA. Farewell, sweet masters, both: I must be gone . [_Exeunt Bianca and Servant.] LUCENTIO.

I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand. LUCENTIO. I read that I profess, _The Art to Love_ Signior Lucentio, Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more, but do forswear her, As one unworthy all the former favours That I fondly flatter’d her withal . TRANIO. And here I take the like unfeigned oath, I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov’d me . I take my leave, In resolution as 'Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come You might have heard it else proclaim’d about. I have bills for money by exchange From Florence, and must here deliver them. TRANIO. To save your life in this extremity, This favour will I do you for his sake; And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio. You understand me, sir, and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty. KATHERINA. Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest. GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not: you shall have the mustard, Or else you get no beef of Grumio . GARDENSHER. Let it stand. PETRUCHIO. The poorest service is repaid with thanks; And so shall mine, before you touch the meat. TAILOR. You bid me make it orderly and well, According to the fashion and the time. PETRUCHIO.

BIONDELLO. Tut! fear not me. TRANIO. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista? Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of; I pray you stand good father to me now; Give me Bianca for my patrimony . Sir, I cannot be with you, Signior Baptista LUCENTIO. Come on, i’ God’s name; once more toward our father’s . PETRUCHIO. I know it is the moon, or sun, or what you please . KATHERINA.

Atala," The frame story: A young disillusioned Frenchman, René, has joined an Indian tribe and married a woman named Céluta. On a hunting expedition, one moonlit night, René asks Chactas, the old man who adopted him, to relate the story of his life. At the age of seventeen, the Natchez Chactas loses his father during a battle against the Muscogees. He flees to St Augustine, Florida, where he is raised in the household of the Spaniard Lopez. After 2½ years, he sets out for home, but is captured by the Muscogees and Seminoles. The chief Simagan sentences him to be burnt in their village. The women take pity on him during the weeks of travel, and each night bring him gifts. Atala, the half-caste Christian daughter of Simagan, tries in vain to help him escape. On arrival at Apalachucla, his bonds are loosed and he is saved from death by her intervention. They run away and roam the wilderness for 27 days before being caught in a huge storm. While they are sheltering, Atala tells Chactas that her father was Lopez, and he realises that she is the daughter of his erstwhile benefactor. Lightning strikes a tree close by, and they run at random before hearing a church bell. Encountering a dog, they are met by its owner, Père Aubry, and he leads them through the storm to his idyllic mission. Aubry's kindness and force of personality impress Chactas greatly. Atala falls in love with Chactas, but cannot marry him as she has taken a vow of chastity. In despair she takes poison. Aubry assumes that she is merely ill, but in the presence of Chactas she reveals what she has done, and Chactas is filled with anger until the missionary tells them that in fact Christianity permits the renunciation of vows. They tend her, but she dies, and the day after the funeral, Chactas takes Aubry's advice and leaves the mission. In an epilogue it is revealed that Aubry was later killed by Cherokees, and that, according to Chactas's granddaughter, neither René nor the aged Chactas survived a massacre during an uprising. The full account of Chactas's wanderings after Atala's death, in Les Natchez, gives a somewhat different version of their fates.
","François Auguste de Chateaubriand was great both by his character and abilities; and while his celebrity is undiminished by the lapse of time, his works are still read and will long continue to be read and admired, even through all changes in the manners and sentiments of mankind . He who has once truly stirred the human heart in its purest depths speaks not alone to his own generation, but belongs to all other The present work, “Atala,” is the gathered fruit of his previous studies amid the wilds of America . It abounds in sparkling description, romantic incident and sentiments tender and heroic . The illustrations of M. Doré have given an additional value to this tale . ‘Atala’ was written in the desert, beneath the huts of the savages . It is divided into Prologue, Recital and Epilogue . The principal parts of the story have each a denomination, such as ‘The Hunters,’ ‘The Laborers,’ etc. ‘Atala’ has been reprinted eleven times--five times separately and six times in the ‘Genius of Christianity’ . It is certain that there was a savage at the galleys and at the court of Louis XIV. I have passed four years in the revision of this episode; but it is now as I intend it to remain . The new nature and the new manners I have described have also drawn upon me another ill-considered reproach . I have been taken for the inventor of certain extraordinary details, whereas I merely repeated circumstances well known to all travellers . On the western border vast savannahs spread away farther than the eye can reach, and their waves of verdure appear to rise gradually into the azure sky . In these limitless meadows herds of three or four thousand wild buffaloes wander at random . Sometimes, cleaving the waters, a bison, laden with years, comes to repose among the high grass on an in 1725 a Frenchman named René arrived at Louisiana, and asked to be accepted as a warrior of that nation . Chactas, whose age, wisdom and knowledge of affairs of life, bore the tale of his calamities even to the shores of France . The savages ascended the Mississippi as far as the territory of the Natchez . Old man, Chactas, was appointed by the council of the wise men to command the expedition . With the help of the counter-currents, the pirogues reascended the Mississippi, and reached the bed of the Ohio . The genii, the least learned of whom possesses more wisdom than all mankind together, are a singular one . I see in you the wild man whom the Great Spirit (I know not I fell away visibly: sometimes I remained motionless for hours while contemplating the summits of distant forests . I figured to myself the woods through which those waters had passed, and my soul was thus entirely given up to solitude . The Seminole is full of gaiety, love and contentment . His walk is light, his mien calm and open. He speaks much, and with volubility . Even age does not deprive the sachems of this joyous simplicity . They asked me if my cradle of moss had been hung upon the flowering branches of the maple-trees . The young maiden then said to me, ‘I am not the Virgin of the last Loves. Are you a Christian?’ . At these words the Indian made an involuntary movement, and said, ‘i pity you for being merely a wicked idolator. My name is Atala, and I am the daughter of Simaghan of the Golden Bracelets, the chief of the warriors of this troop Atala, the daughter of the desert, was as much affected as her prisoner . At these words, courage returned to my tongue, and I replied, ‘But slightly held, O woman!’---- I could not complete my phrase . I seized the cord, and returned it to the hand of the foreign maiden, forcing her beautiful fingers to close themselves upon my chain . ‘You are mad!’ I replied with tears, O Atala cried, ‘I really grieve for you! You wish me, then, to weep my whole heart out?’ She said, ‘Let us leave this place’ . “I had just abandoned the generous-hearted Lopez; I had just exposed myself to every danger for the sake of liberty, and in one instant the look of a woman had changed my tastes, my resolutions, my thoughts! I had suddenly 'May Mila extinguish this torch! May her mouth cast a voluptuous shade over it! I will smoke my calumet of peace by the cradle of my son' 'We passed near a child’s tomb, which served as a boundary between two nations, and we were diverted from this scene' 'Why do I weep for thee in thy earthly cradle, O my new-born? 'When the little bird has grown, it must seek its own nutriment, and finds many bitter seeds in the desert' 'What could save Atala? what could prevent her from succumbing to Nature?' Apalachucla was situated on the banks of the river Chata-Uche . It was to decide upon this important matter that the mico had convoked the sachems, or wise men . The council assembled. Fifty old men were ranged upon the steps facing the door . a triple row of old men, matrons, and warriors--the priests, the clouds of incense, and the sacrifice--imparted to this council an aspect altogether imposing . The mico, sachems, and matrons spoke thus: ‘Let us change nothing in the manners of our forefathers: let us burn the prisoner, and let us not allow our courage to be a long hut had been constructed upon an isolated situation . Each cabin exhumed the remains of its fathers from their private tombs . The skeletons were hung upon the walls of the Common-room of the Ancestors . I began to sing the song of death: * Blushing is a marked characteristic with young savages . In their impatience to enjoy the spectacle, and in order to be ready sooner on the break of day, the Indians did not quit the Wood of Blood . They lighted large fires, and began a series of festivities and dances. Atala remained motionless, and looked at him . The Indian thought he was looking at the Spirit of the ruins; and he lay down again, and sat up . When day broke upon the Apalaches, we were already far away . I fell on my knees, and said to the daughter of Simaghan: ‘You are a genius; you have visited me, and I cannot speak before you Intoxication, which lasts a long time upon savages, prevented them from pursuing us during the first few days . If they sought for us afterwards, it was probably in a westerly direction, as they must have thought we should make for the Mississippi; but we had taken our flight towards the fixed star, ** guiding ourselves by the moss on the trunks of the trees . We blessed Heaven for having placed this limpid spring upon the stalk of a flower, in the midst of the corrupted marshes, just as it has caused virtue to well up from the bosom of the miseries of life . Atala could not hold a weak empire over a man, she must either be adored or hated . 'Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and who have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their fathers!' 'The Indian village of Stico, with its pyramidal tombs and ruined huts, appeared on our left at the turn of a promontory; on the right we left the valley of Keow' The solitude, the constant presence of the beloved object, even our misfortunes, increased our affection from one instant to another . Atala prayed continuously to her mother, whose irritated shade she seemed as though wishing to appease . The heart of man is like a river-sponge, that imbibes pure water during calm weather, and is swollen with muddy liquid when the The Great Spirit covered the mountain with heavy darkness . From the midst of this chaos there arose a confused moaning, formed by the rushing of the winds, the cracking of trees, the buzzing of wild beasts, and the repeated fall of thunderbolts hissing as they died out in the waters . My mother said to her new spouse, “My bosom has conceived; kill me” Simaghan replied to her, “May the Great Spirit preserve me from such an action! You have been sincere and have not betrayed my couch.” My mother made me a Christian, so that her God and the God of my father might also be my God. Afterwards love-sickness fell upon her, and she went down into the An old hermit, carrying a small lantern, was following the animal through the darkness of the forest . ‘Heaven be praised!’ he cried, as soon as he perceived us; ‘I have brought a bear-skin. It shall be for this young woman, and there is some wine in our gourd!’ “Atala threw herself at the feet of the monk. ‘Ch 'My grotto is not far from here, in the mountain. You shall have shelter, and you should thank the Divine goodness even for that, for there are many men who are without it,' said the missionary . The storm of heaven appeared to recede at the hermit's voice . I have dwelt in these solitudes nearly thirty years, and it will be twenty-two to-morrow since I took possession of this rock . When I came to the place, I encountered but a few wandering families, whose manners were ferocious and whose life was miserable . I had induced them to listen to the word of Peace, and their manners have become gradually softened . Atala was awakened by the songs of the cardinals and the mockingbirds, nestled in the acacias and laurels that surrounded the grotto . He told me that the soul of some child dead at the breast might have descended upon this flower in a dew-drop, and that a happy dream might convey it to the bosom of my future spouse . At His name, his age, and the date of his mission were also marked upon a reed of the savannah at the foot of those trees . ‘It will last longer than I,’ replied the father, ‘and it will always be of more value than the little good I have done’ . It is not the same with Nature when she appears to imitate the labors of men by in reality offering them models Father Aubry asked as he went along of what was going on in the village . He spoke of harvests to be gathered, of children to be instructed, of troubles to be consoled; and alluded to God in every topic he touched upon. I admired the triumph of Christianity over savage life . I assisted at the primitive union of man and the earth, by this great contract, abandoning to the earth the inheritance of his labors . The earth undertaking in return to bear faithfully the harvests, the sons, and the ashes of man . The hermit had lighted a pine-torch, which he was holding with a trembling hand over Atala's couch . With her hair in disorder, the young and beautiful woman looked pale and suffering . Atalala was the first to break it . O Chactas, I am leaving you in a world that is not worthy of possessing a Christian--in the midst of idolators who persecute the God of your father and of your mother . O Religion, the cause of my ills and of my felicity, my ruin and my consolation at the same time! And you, dear and sad object of a passion that is consuming me even ‘I saw myself surrounded by men unworthy of receiving my hand, and I congratulated myself upon having no other spouse than the God of my mother’ . ‘To save you,’ said the old man, in a terrible voice, ‘to conquer your passions, and to prevent you, blasphemer, from drawing down upon yourself the wrath of Heaven!’ “I saw you, young and beautiful thy shadow, O my mother, reminds me of tortures . To have passed my life at your feet, to have waited upon you like a slave, to prepare your repasts and your couch in some unknown corner of the universe, would have been for me supreme happiness . The Good Shepherd would have sought for you, and would have brought you back to the flock . Let us address ourselves to God, who heals all the wounds of His servants . If it be His will, as I trust it may be, that you escape this malady, I will write to the Bishop of Quebec; he has the power to release you from your vows, which are but simple vows; and you shall O Chactas, judge of my astonishment when I found that the result was not so prompt as I had expected! The old priest, with wonderful tenderness, ran from brother to sister, endeavoring to relieve us in a thousand ways . Does not this priest, who had passed forty years of daily sacrifice in the service of God and man upon the mountain, remind you of the holocausts of Israel smoking perpetually God will pardon you, on account of the simplicity of your heart . Your mother, and the imprudent missionary who guided her are more to be blamed than you . You all three offer a terrible example of the dangers of enthusiasm, and of the want of enlightenment on religious matters . The bitterness attendant upon human affections is so powerful that I have seen grand ladies quit the life of a court to bury themselves in a cloister, and mutilate that rebellious flesh . I also, my daughter, have known the troubles of the heart . This head has not been always bald, nor this breast always so calm as it appears to you to-day . The heart, Chactas, is like those trees that only yield their balm for healing men’s wounds after having been themselves seared with iron . When she had thus spoken, Atala turned towards the missionary, seeking from him the consolation she had been endeavoring to impart to me . The humble grotto was full of the grandeur of this Christian agony . Chactas, I only desire you to make me a simple promise . If you have loved me, get yourself instructed in the Christian religion, which will prepare our re-union . The earth is crying out to me, ‘When, then, wilt thou go down into the tomb, and for what art ... ... I hope to be re-united to Atala... But let me finish what remains to be told of my story’ . “The mild tenderness and the unvarying patience of the old servant of God at length conquered the obstinacy of my grief; Atala's misfortunes and virtues were unknown to men . It was also decided that we should pass the night in prayer near the corpse of the saint . She appeared as though enchanted by the angel of melancholy and by the double sleep of innocence . 'Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul?' ""Thus sang the old man. His deep and irregular voice went rolling through the silence of the desert . At the sight of the dog which had found us in the forest, and which now led us by another route, I melted into tears . Outalissi, so long as Atala was alive, I myself desired that you should live with me . Sooner or later they wear themselves out, because the heart of man is finite . Return to the Mississippi; go and console your mother, who weeps for you day by day . In return for your love, for your exile, and for your death, you are going to be abandoned, even by Chactas!’ Then, I separated from Lopez’s daughter, leaving at the foot of nature’s monument a monument still more august--the humble Tomb of Virtue . I saw in this story the picture of the hunting people and of the laboring people; religion, the first lawgiver of a woman was groaning at the foot of the maple-tree, and placed her hands upon her head as I uttered the three cries of grief . She imitated her by taking a bough and driving away the insects that were buzzing about the child’s body . The Indian woman said to it: “Dove, if thou art not the soul of my departed son, The cataract is formed by the river Niagara, which takes its rise in Lake Erie, and falls into Lake Ontario . Its perpendicular height is one hundred and forty-four feet . Between the two falls there is an island, hollow underneath, and which hangs with all its trees over the chaos of the waves . Father Aubry was burned with great torture; but his enemies could not draw from him a single cry that might be turned to the shame of his God or to the dishonor of his country . In order to compel him to betray a mark of weakness, the Cherokees led to his feet a Christian savage . Chactas wandered about the place for a long time: he visited the hermit’s grotto, and occupied by a fawn giving suck to her kid . He sat down upon the rock beneath which he had watched his dying Atala; but there was nothing on it beyond a few feathers fallen from the wings of some birds of passage .

Anne of Avonlea," Anne is about to start her first term teaching at the Avonlea school, although she will still continue her studies at home with Gilbert, who is teaching at the nearby White Sands School. The book soon introduces Anne's new and problematic neighbor, Mr. Harrison, and his foul-mouthed parrot, as well as the twins, Davy and Dora. They are the children of Marilla's third cousin and she takes them in when their mother dies while their uncle is out of the country. Dora is a nice, well-behaved girl, somewhat boring in her perfect behaviour. Ironically Davy is an exact opposite, much more of a handful and constantly getting into many scrapes. They are initially meant to stay only a short time, but the twins' uncle postpones his return to collect the twins and then eventually dies. Both Anne and Marilla are relieved (Marilla inwardly of course) to know the twins will remain with her. Other characters introduced are some of Anne's new pupils, such as Paul Irving, an American boy living with his grandmother in Avonlea while his widower father works in the States. He delights Anne with his imagination and whimsical ways, which are reminiscent of Anne's in her childhood. Later in the book, Anne and her friends meet Miss Lavendar Lewis, a sweet but lonely lady in her 40s who had been engaged to Paul's father 25 years before, but parted from him after a disagreement. At the end of the book, Mr. Irving returns and he and Miss Lavendar marry. Anne discovers the delights and troubles of being a teacher, takes part in the raising of Davy and Dora, and organizes the A.V.I.S. (Avonlea Village Improvement Society) together with Gilbert, Diana, and Fred Wright, though their efforts to improve the town are not always successful. The Society takes up a subscription to repaint an old town hall, only to have the painter provide the wrong color of paint, turning the hall into a bright blue eyesore. Towards the end of the book, Mrs. Rachel Lynde's husband dies and Mrs. Lynde moves in with Marilla at Green Gables, allowing Anne to go to college at last. She and Gilbert make plans to attend Redmond College in the fall. This book sees Anne maturing slightly, even though she still cannot avoid getting into a number of her familiar scrapes, as only Anne can—some of which include selling her neighbor's cow (having mistaken it for her own), or getting stuck in a broken duck house roof while peeping into a pantry window.

The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse," Danny begins his tale regretting the length of his tail until he is corrected by Mr. Toad. Then he has a series of stalkings by Reddy and Granny Fox. He is captured by Hooty the Owl and escapes mid-flight to Peter Rabbit's briar patch. Peter goes to Farmer Brown's peach orchard and gets caught in a snare and barely escapes himself. Finally Danny gets trapped in a tin can and must use his wits to escape Reddy Fox again.

THEADWAYS OF UNC’ BILLY POSSUM 5. THEADBOOKS OF JERRY MUSKRAT 7. THEADTERER, THE RED SQUIRREL 10. THE Danny Meadow Mouse was worried because his tail is short . It is the easiest thing in the world to find something to worry about . And when you make yourself uncomfortable, you are almost sure to make every one around you equally uncomfortable . Don't worry because they are homely or freckled, or short or tall . Old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk spied Danny sitting there moping on his door-step . If it hadn’t been for one of the Merry Little Breezes, Danny would have been caught . I don’t suppose that there really is anything the matter, but what do you think is the matter? Old Mr. Toad sat down in front of Danny and began to ask questions . Danny Meadow Mouse always keeps his eyes open when they are around and always begins to play hide and seek . When rough Brother North Wind came shouting across the Green Meadows, tearing to pieces the snow clouds and shaking out the snowflakes until they covered the green Meadows deep, deep, Danny just snuggled down in his warm coat in his snug little house of grass and waited . Danny Meadow Mouse was scurrying along one of his little tunnels . When Reddy Fox stopped digging, Reddy popped his head out of another doorway and laughed at him . After a while Danny grew tired of this kind of a game and tried another plan . Then he waited and dropped out of sight. No sooner was he gone . Old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox went down on the meadows where Danny Meadow Mouse lives . When he saw them, Danny’s heart beat a little faster than before . He scurried down out of sight to see that all his little tunnels were clear so he could run fast through them if he had to . Old Granny Fox dived right into the snow and right through into the tunnel of Danny Meadow Mouse . It was lucky for him that Danny had just turned into another tunnel, for otherwise she would surely have caught him . Now Reddy Fox is quick to learn, especially when it is a way to get something to eat . Old Granny Fox squealed in greater fright as Reddy Fox crashed down into his tunnel . The old fence-post lay on the ground and was hollow. Fastened to it were long wires with sharp cruel barbs . “Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” he sobbed, and right that very instant he remembered the old fence post . Danny Meadow Mouse was dressing the scratch on his leg made by the claws of old Granny Fox . She knew that he was fat, and it made her mouth water every time she thought of him . Then he’ll come out and run around on top of the snow to get some of the seeds in the tops of the tall grasses that stick out through the snow . Danny Meadow Mouse had seen nothing of old Granny Fox or Reddy Fox for several days . The next morning, when he started to climb up to one of his little doorways, he found that it was closed . ""To-morrow morning I’ll have fat Meadow Mouse for breakfast,"" she said . He ate a good breakfast of seeds which he had stored in the hollow . IX DANNY MEADOW MOUSE sang this, or at least he tried to sing it, as he skipped about on the snow that covered the Green Meadows . He thought he was, though, and was enjoying it just as much as if he had the most beautiful voice in the world . ""I don’t see anything or anybody to be afraid of,"" said Danny . Danny Meadow Mouse forgot to watch up in the sky, and never once thought of Hooty the Owl . The longer he hunted, the hungrier and crosser he grew . It seems as if he drifts along through the air like a great shadow . Danny Meadow Mouse was being carried through the air in the cruel claws of Hooty the Owl . But it wasn’t the pain that was the worst. No, Sir, he couldn’t keep them shut . There was the Old Briar-patch where Peter Rabbit lives so safely . Danny Meadow Mouse shut his eyes and held his breath. Down, down, down he fell . It seemed to him that he never would strike the snow-covered meadows . The last thing he remembered was hearing the scream of disappointment and rage of Hooty the Owl . Danny Meadow Mouse opened his eyes and then closed them again quickly, as if afraid to look around . It was a pleasant voice, not at all like the terrible voice of Hooty the Owl . Danny had a fierce scream of rage and disappointment . The very last thing he could remember was how he had caught him in great cruel claws . Danny Meadow Mouse was all torn and hurt by Hooty the Owl's cruel claws . ""However shall I get back home to my warm house of grass?"" Peter Rabbit said . “You simply can’t do it. It is such a long way for a little fellow like you that it wouldn’t be safe to try. You can come out in broad daylight and laugh at Granny and Reddy Fox and at old Roughleg the Hawk, and if they did, they would be sure Peter Rabbit left the dear safe Old Briar-patch and left the orchard back . Danny Meadow Mouse watched him go and shook his head in disapproval . ""Why can’t Peter be content with the good things that he has?"" he hurried along through the moonlight, stopping every few minutes to sit up . Bowser the Hound had hung around nearly all night, so that Peter had not dared to try to go home . Now it was daylight, and Peter knew it would not be safe to put his nose outside . By and by they saw the mischief which Peter had done, and they were very, very angry . They went away, but before long they were back again . XV PETER RABBIT IS CAUGHT IN A SNARE WHEN Peter Rabbit reached up to nibble the bark of one of Farmer Brown’s young trees . The thing on his hind leg had tightened and held him fast, but it didn’t pull when he lay still . When he had grown a little calmer, Peter sat up to examine the thing which held him so fast . He thought of the stake to which that hateful wire was fastened . Peter Rabbit! There wasn’t time to finish cutting off the stake . Just as before, he was thrown flat on his face . He scrambled to his feet and jumped again, only to be thrown just as before . It was hard work, for you know he had to drag that piece of stake after him . XVII DANNY MEADOW MOUSE limped around through the dear Old Briar-patch . Danny Meadow Mouse was sitting on the edge of it anxiously watching for him . Peter Rabbit squirmed out of the claws of Hooty the Owl and dropped there, right at the feet . Then Peter waited a little longer, listening with all his might . Danny Meadow Mouse had grown very fond of Peter Rabbit . It had been very good of Peter to offer to share the Old Briar-patch with Danny . But now, as Danny limped around, Danny was not happy . No, Sir, he was worried about some one else . Danny hurried over to Peter and tears stood in his eyes . “Poor Peter Rabbit! Oh, I’m so sorry, Peter!” he whispered . So Peter just dropped on the snow and cried . You see he was so tired and worn out and frightened, and his leg was so stiff and sore and hurt him so! And then it was so dreadful to get home and be stopped right on your very own door-step! Just remember that to-morrow Farmer Brown’s boy came up to the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch . Danny hurried to tell Peter Rabbit that there was nothing to stop him from going to his most secret retreat in the very heart of the old Briar . In spite of his pain, Peter was curious. Finally he called Danny Meadow Mouse . Danny Meadow Mouse slipped the cruel wire snare off of Peter’s leg . But Danny didn’t know it until Danny held it up in front of him . It was a long time before Peter could hop as he used to, but after the first day he managed to get around . Every day Farmer Brown’s boy stole the bait, and Peter Rabbit lived high . Old Mr. Toad looked up sharply when Danny mentioned homely and ugly looking people . “Well, I think you may be right, but for my part fear seems a very foolish thing,” he said . ""Oh, it’s not so bad. It must be dreadful to feel hungry eyes are watching for you every minute of the day and night, too."" Danny had been thinking about grass-seed for some time and waiting for it to get ripe . To reach it he had to cross an open place where the grass was so short that he couldn’t make a path under it . Now he can run very fast along his private little paths, but he knew that Mr. Blacksnake could run faster . Danny waited long enough to get his breath and ran back along the path to where another little path branched off . He took the latter and scampered on, sure that by this time Mr. Blacksnake would be so badly fooled that he would give up the chase . ""Brains are better far than speed As wise men long ago agreed,"" says Danny . Danny Meadow Mouse screamed with rage and disappointment as he struck the old tomato can . Then he flew back to the tree from which he had first seen Danny . XXIII REDDY FOX GROWS CURIOUS DANNY MEADOW MOUSE had sat perfectly still for a long time . It wasn’t meant that Danny should have that nap, but his ears were still open . Reddy had seen Redtail strike and strike again at something on the ground . Redtail had seen Danny dodged into the old tomato can . ""Now, I wonder what it was Redtail was after and why he didn’t get it,"" said Reddy . Reddy was too frightened to answer, but his bright eyes never left Reddy's cruel face . For a long time Reddy lay there licking his chops and saying all the things he could think of to fake Reddy away . At last he grew tired of this and made up his mind that it was time to end it and Danny Meadow Mouse at the same time. The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse, by Thornton W.

Measure for Measure," Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna, makes it known that he intends to leave the city on a diplomatic mission. He leaves the government in the hands of a strict judge, Angelo. Claudio, a young nobleman, is betrothed/unofficially married to Juliet. At the time, marriages were supposed to be announced by banns in advance. Due to lack of money, Claudio and Juliet did not observe all the technicalities. This did not make them unique however; at the time most people (including the Church) would have considered them married. Technically, however, all the formalities for a civil marriage had not been followed and so a strict judge might rule that they were not legally married. Angelo, as the personification of the law, decides to enforce the ruling that fornication is punishable by death, and since he does not accept the validity of the marriage, Claudio is sentenced to be executed. Claudio's friend, Lucio, visits Claudio's sister, Isabella, a novice nun, and asks her to intercede with Angelo on Claudio's behalf. Isabella obtains an audience with Angelo, and pleads for mercy for Claudio. Over the course of two scenes between Angelo and Isabella, it becomes clear that he harbours lustful thoughts about her, and he eventually offers her a deal: Angelo will spare Claudio's life if Isabella yields him her virginity. Isabella refuses, but she also realises that (due to Angelo's austere reputation) she will not be believed if she makes a public accusation against him. Instead she visits her brother in prison and counsels him to prepare himself for death. Claudio vehemently begs Isabella to save his life, but Isabella refuses. As a novice nun, she feels that she cannot sacrifice her own immortal soul (and that of Claudio's, if he causes her to lose her virtue) to save Claudio's transient earthly life. The Duke has not in fact left the city, but remains there disguised as a friar (Lodowick) in order to spy on the city's affairs, and especially on the actions of Angelo. In his guise as a friar he befriends Isabella and arranges two tricks to thwart Angelo's evil intentions: #First, a ""bed trick"" is arranged. Angelo has previously refused to fulfill the betrothal binding him to Mariana, because her dowry had been lost at sea. Isabella sends word to Angelo that she has decided to submit to him, making it a condition of their meeting that it occurs in perfect darkness and in silence. Mariana agrees to take Isabella's place, and she has sex with Angelo, although he continues to believe he has enjoyed Isabella. (In some interpretations of the law, this constitutes consummation of their betrothal, and therefore their marriage. This is the same interpretation that assumes that Claudio and Juliet are legally married.) #After having sex with Mariana (who he thinks is Isabella), Angelo goes back on his word, sending a message to the prison that he wishes to see Claudio's head, and necessitating the ""head trick."" The Duke first attempts to arrange the execution of another prisoner whose head can be sent instead of Claudio's. However, the villain Barnardine refuses to be executed in his drunken state. As luck would have it, a pirate named Ragozine, of similar appearance to Claudio, has recently died of a fever, so his head is sent to Angelo instead. This main plot concludes with the 'return' to Vienna of the Duke as himself. Isabella and Mariana publicly petition him, and he hears their claims against Angelo, which Angelo smoothly denies. As the scene develops, it appears that Friar Lodowick will be blamed for the 'false' accusations levelled against Angelo. The Duke leaves Angelo to judge the cause against Lodowick, but returns in disguise moments later when Lodowick is summoned. Eventually the friar reveals himself to be the Duke, thereby exposing Angelo as a liar and Isabella and Mariana as truthful. He proposes that Angelo be executed but first compels him to marry Mariana— with his estate going to Mariana as her new dowry, ""to buy you a better husband"". Mariana pleads for Angelo's life, even enlisting the aid of Isabella (who is not yet aware her brother Claudio is still living). The Duke pretends not to heed the women's petition, and only after revealing that Claudio has not, in fact, been executed, relents. The Duke then proposes marriage to Isabella. Isabella does not reply, and her reaction is interpreted differently in different productions: her silent acceptance of his proposal is the most common in performance. This is one of the ""open silences"" of the play. A sub-plot concerns Claudio's friend Lucio, who frequently slanders the duke to the friar, and in the last act slanders the friar to the duke, providing opportunities for comic consternation on Vincentio's part and landing Lucio in trouble when it is revealed that the duke and the friar are one and the same. His punishment, like Angelo's, is to be forced into an undesired marriage: in this case with the prostitute Kate Keepdown.

The heavens give safety to your purposes! ESCALUS. Lead forth and bring you back in happiness! DUKE. I will desire you, sir, to give me leave To have free speech with you; and it concerns me To look into the bottom of my place: A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature I am not yet instructed. SECOND GENTLEMAN. I think, or in any religion. LUCIO. Ay, why not? Grace is grace MRS. OVERDONE. I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child . 'Tis not so. I saw him arrested; saw him carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his head to be chopp'd off,' says Claudio . MRS OVERdONE. But what's his offence? POMPEY. To the ground, mistress. LUCIO. From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty; As surfeit is the father of much fast; and when we drink we die . CLAUDIO. What but to speak of would offend again . Claudio, who isn't murder, is writ on Juliet . The new governor Awakes me all the enrolled penalties . LUCIO. In her youth There is a prone and speechless dialect Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art When she will play with reason and discourse, And well she can persuade . CLAUDIO. I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition . ISABELLA. You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn; When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men But in presence of the prioress . LUCIO. Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you. Not to be weary with you, he's in prison . 'tis thus: Your brother and his lover have embrac'd . ISABELLA. I will about it straight; soon at night I'll send him certain word of my success . LUCIO. I take my leave of you. I can do it straight. Let me give the Mother Notice of my affair . The Duke is very strangely gone from hence; Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn, By those that know the very nerves of state, His givings-out were of an infinite distance From his true-me Claudio Be executed by nine to-morrow morning; Bring him his confessor; let him be prepar'd; For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage . ANGELO. Where is the Provost? PROVOST. Here, if it like your honour, I know not well what they are; but precise villains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have. ESCALUS. How dost thou know that, constable? ELBOW. Ay, sir, by my wife; but as she spit in his face, so she defied him . POMPEY. Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so. ESCalUS. Go to, go to; no matter for the dish, Sir, and if you be rememb'red, cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes ANGELO. This will last out a night in Russia, When nights are longest there; I'll take my leave, And leave you to the hearing of the cause, Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all. ESCALUS. I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship. POMPEY. I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife, once more? . ELBOW. He's in the right, constable POMPEY. Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then . ESCALUS. I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine . Exit FROTH. Come hither to me, Master Froth, and you will hang them . ANGELO is a woeful suitor to your honour, Please but your honour hear me . I crave your honour's pardon, sir. ISABELLA PROVOST . I have a brother is condemn'd to die; I do beseech you, let it be his fault, And not my brother. PROVOST. [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces. ANGELO. Condemn the fault and not the actor of it! LUCIO. [To ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat him, Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown; You are too cold: if you should I show it most of all when I show justice; For then I pity those I do not know, Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall, And do him right that, answering one foul wrong, Lives not to act another. Be satisfied; Your brother dies to-morrow; be content. ISABELLA. But it's excellent To have a giant's strength! ANGELO. At any time 'fore noon' Shall I attend your lordship? ISABELLA. Save your honour! Exeunt all but I That, lying by the violet in the sun, Do as the carrion does, not as the flow'r, Corrupt with virtuous season . I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar? DUKE. I do; and bear the shame most patiently . JULIET. I do confess it, and repent it, father. DUKE. 'Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent as it is an evil, And take the shame with joy. ANGELO. When I would pray and think, I think and pray To several subjects. The state whereon I studied Is, like good thing being often read, Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity, Could I with boot change for an idle plume Which the ISABELLA. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins Stand more for number than for accomptt . I'll take it as a peril to my soul It is no sin at all, but charity. ANGELO. Nay, but hear me; Your sense pursues not mine; either you are ignorant Or seem so, craftily; and that's not good . Ignominy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses: lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemption . ISABELLA. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant; And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice . ANGELO. Nay, women are frail too . Exit ISABELLA: To whom should I complain? O perilous mouths That bear in them one and the self-same tongue Either of condemnation or approof, Bidding the law make curtsy to their will; Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite, To follow as it draws! I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request, And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest . I have hope to live, and am prepar'd CLAUDIO. I humbly thank you. To sue to live, I find I seek to die; And, seeking death, find life . Let it come on. Enter ISABELLA. DUKE. Provost, a word with you. PROVOST. As many as you please . In such a one as, you consenting to't, Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, And leave you naked . ISABELLA. O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell The damned'st body to invest and cover In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio, If I would yield him my virginity Thou mightst be freed? CLAUDIO. Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence, So to offend him still. I'd throw it down for your deliverance As frankly as a pin. CLAUDI. O I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to death . Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible; to-morrow you must die . Leave me a while with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company . DUKE. It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it keeps you from dishonour in doing it . I will presently to Saint Luke's; there, at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana . The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection. ELBOW. Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and we take him to be a thief too . I would prove- DUKE. I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend of mine. LUCIO. How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? POMPEY. What say'st thou to't? POMPEY. You will not bail me then, sir? LUCIO. Then, Pompey, nor now. What news, friar, of the Duke? DUKE. I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well . SUKE. It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it . LUCO. 'Tis not possible. You are deceiv'd, and he was not inclin'd that way,' DU LUCIO. Sir, I know him, and I love him. DUKE. I fear you not . if ever the Duke return, as our prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your answer before him . Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing; back-wounding calumny The whitest virtue strikes . MRS. OVERDONE ESCALUS. Your honour is accounted a merciful man, good my lord . DUKE. Rather rejoicing to see another merry at anything which profess'd to make him rejoice; a gentleman of all temperance . I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well . Exeunt ESCALUS and PROVOST He who the sword of heaven will bear Should be as holy as severe; Pattern in himself to know, Grace to stand, and virtue go; More nor less to others paying Than by self-offences weighing. Shame to him whose cruel striking Kills for faults of his own liking! DUKE. Do you persuade yourself that I respect you? MARIANA. Good friar, I know you do, and have found it . 'Tis well borne up. I have not yet made known to Mariana A word of this. What ho, within! come forth. I pray you be acquainted with this maid; She comes to do you good. ISABELLA. It is not my consent, But my entreaty too. PROVOST. Do you call, sir? Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your execution . If you think it meet, compound with him by the year, and let him abide here with you . He cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd . Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more penitent trade . Exit PROVOST This is a gentle provost; seldom when The steeled gaoler is the friend of men . Enter a MESSENGER This is his lordship's man. DUKE. And here comes Claudio's pardon . DUKE. He wants advice. PROVOST. He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many times a day . There is written in your brow, Provost, honesty and constancy . I crave but four days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy . The prison Enter POMPEY ABHORSON. You must rise and be hang'd, Master Barnardine! BARNARDINE. You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not fitted for't . Enter DUKE, disguised as before ABHorSON. I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with you . I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion. DUKE. But hear you- BARNARDINE. Not a word; and therefore I beseech you Look forward on the journey you shall go . Exit PROVOST. Here in the prison, father, There died this morning of a cruel fever One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate, A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head Just of his colour . DUKE. O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red. Thou must be patient. You'll answer this one day. Fare ye well. LUCIO. By my troth, Isabel, I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty tales of the Duke. I was once before him for getting a wench with child . I'm fain to forswear it: they would else have married me to the  ANGELO. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his ent'ring that, if any crave redress of injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in the street? ESCALUS. He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of complaints; and to deliver us from devices hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand against us . ANGELO, ESCALUS, Lucio, PROVOST, OFFICERS, and CITIZENS DUKE. O worthy Prince, dishonour not your eye By throwing it on any other object Till you have heard me in my true complaint, And given me justice, Justice, justice, justice. ISABELLA. Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak. Angelo's forsworn, is not strange? Angelo is an adulterous thief, An hypocrit ISABELLA. It's not truer he is Angelo Than this is all as true as it is strange . Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth To th' end of reck'ning. DUKE. O Prince! I conjure thee, as thou believ'st There is another comfort than this world . Believe it, royal Prince, If she be less, as I believe no other, Her madness hath the oddest I know you'd fain be gone. An officer! To prison with her! DUKE. A ghostly father, belike! And to set on this wretched woman here Against our substitute! I know him for a man divine and holy; Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler, As he's reported by this gentleman . MARIANA. No, my lord. DUKE. I will not show my face Until my husband bids me . ANGELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face, thou cruel Angelo, whose swor'st was worth the looking on; This is the hand which took away the match from Isabel . LUCIO. 'Cucullus non facit monachum': honest in nothing but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the Duke. ESCALUS. We shall entreat you to abide here till you have well determin'd Upon these slanderers . DUKE. Ay, with my heart; And punish them to your height of pleasure. You, Lord Escalus, Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains To find out Is the Duke gone? Then is your cause gone too . LUCIO. This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. ESCALUS. Take him hence; to th' rack with him . DUKE. You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report; you, indeed, spoke so of him; and much more, much worse . O my lord, I should be guiltier than my guiltiness, To think I can be undiscernible, When I perceive your Grace, like pow'r divine, Hath look'd upon my passes, And hold no longer out. DUKE. Come hither, Isabel. Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart; And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself, Labouring to save his life, and would not rather Make rash remonstrance of O my dear lord, I crave no other, nor no better man. DUKE. Never crave him; we are definitive. MARIANA. Gentle my liege- [Kneeling] You do yet but kneel by me; Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all. They say best men moulded out of faults; And, for the most, become much more the better For being a little bad; so may my husband . I partly think A due sincerity govern JULIET DUKE, a punk, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging . The head of Ragozine for Claudio's: Th' offence pardons itself . I have a motion much imports your good; Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline, What's mine is yours, and see our pleasure herein executed.",1.3293643568087774,0.14501891164679448
The Trial," On his thirtieth birthday, the chief financial officer of a bank, Josef K., is unexpectedly arrested by two unidentified agents from an unspecified agency for an unspecified crime. The agents' boss later arrives and holds a mini tribunal in the room of K.'s neighbor, Fräulein Bürstner. K. is not taken away, however, but left ""free"" to await instructions from the Committee of Affairs. He goes to work, and that night apologizes to Fräulein Bürstner for the intrusion into her room. At the end of the conversation he suddenly kisses her. K. receives a phone calling summoning him to court, and the coming Sunday is arranged as the date. No time is set and the address is given to him. The address turns out to be a huge tenement building. K. has to explore to find the court, which turns out to be in the attic. The room is airless, shabby, and crowded, and although he has no idea what he is charged with, or what authorizes the process, makes a long speech denigrating the whole process, including the agents who arrested him, and during which an attendant's wife is raped. He then returns home. K. later goes to visit the court again, although he has not been summoned. Court is not in session. He instead talks with the attendant's wife, who attempts to seduce him into taking her away, and who gives him more information about the process and offers to help him. K. later goes with the attendant to a higher level of the attic where it turns out that the offices of the court are housed, which are shabby and airless. K. returns home to find Fräulein Montag, a lodger from another room, moving in with Fräulein Bürstner. He suspects that this is to prevent him from pursuing his affair with the latter woman. Yet another lodger, Captain Lanz, appears to be in league with Montag. Later, in a store room at his own bank, K. discovers the two agents, who arrested him, being whipped by a flogger for asking K. for bribes, as a result of complaints K. made at court. K. tries to argue with the flogger, saying that the men need not be whipped, but the flogger cannot be swayed. The next day he returns to the store room and is shocked to find everything as he had found it the day before, including the Whipper and the two agents. K. is visited by his uncle, who was K.'s guardian. The uncle seems distressed by K.'s predicament. At first sympathetic, he becomes concerned K. is underestimating the seriousness of the case. The uncle introduces K. to a lawyer, who is attended by Leni, a nurse, who K.'s uncle suspects is the advocate's mistress. During the discussion it becomes clear how different this process is from regular legal proceedings – guilt is assumed, the bureaucracy running it is vast with many levels, and everything is secret, from the charge, to the rules of the court, to the authority behind the courts – even the identity of the judges at the higher levels. The attorney tells him that he can prepare a brief for K., but since the charge is unknown and the rules are unknown, it is difficult work. It also never may be read. Yet it is very important. The lawyer says that his most important task is to deal with powerful court officials behinds the scenes. As they talk, the lawyer reveals that the Chief Clerk of the Court has been sitting hidden in the darkness of a corner. The Chief Clerk emerges to join the conversation, but K. is called away by Leni, who takes him to the next room, where she offers to help him and seduces him. They have a sexual encounter. Afterwards K. meets his uncle outside, who is angry and, who claims that K.'s lack of respect has also hurt K.'s case. K. visits the lawyer several times. The lawyer tells him incessantly how dire his situation is and tells many stories of other hopeless clients and of his behind-the-scenes efforts on behalf of these clients, and brags about his many connections. The brief is never complete. K.'s work at the bank deteriorates as he is consumed with worry about his case. K. is surprised by one of his bank clients, who tells K. that he is aware that K. is dealing with a trial. The client learned of K.'s case from Titorelli, a painter, who told the client about K.'s case and has dealings with the court. The client advises K. to go to Titorelli for advice. Titorelli lives in the attic of a tenement in a suburb on the opposite side of town from the court that K. visited. Three teenage girls taunt K. on the steps and tease him sexually. Titorelli turns out to be an official painter of portraits for the court – an inherited position, and has a deep understanding of the process. K. learns that, to Titorelli's knowledge, not a single defendant has ever been acquitted. He sets out K.'s options and offers to help K. with either. The options are: obtain a provisional verdict of innocence from the lower court, which can be overturned at any time by higher levels of the court leading to re-initiation of the process; or curry favor with the lower judges to keep the process moving albeit at a glacial pace. Titorelli has K. leave through a small back door as the girls are blocking the door through with K. entered. To K.'s shock, the door opens into another warren of the court's offices – again shabby and airless. K. decides to take control of matters himself and visits his lawyer with the intention of dismissing him. At the lawyer's office he meets a downtrodden individual, Block, a client who offers K. some insight from a client's perspective. Block's case has continued for five years and he has gone from being a successful businessman to being almost bankrupt and is virtually enslaved by his dependence on the lawyer and Leni, with whom he appears to be sexually involved. The lawyer mocks Block in front of K. for his dog-like subservience. This experience further poisons K.'s opinion of his lawyer. (This chapter was left unfinished by the author.) K. is asked by the bank to show an Italian client around local places of cultural interest, but the Italian client, short of time, asks K. to take him only to the cathedral, setting a time to meet there. When the client doesn't show up, K. explores the cathedral which is empty except for an old woman and a church official. K. notices a priest who seems to be preparing to give a sermon from a small second pulpit, and K. begins to leave, lest it begin and K. be compelled to stay for its entirety. Instead of giving a sermon, the priest calls out K.'s name. K. approaches the pulpit and the priest berates him for his attitude toward the trial and for seeking help, especially from women. K. asks him to come down and the two men walk inside the cathedral. The priest works for the court as a chaplain, and tells K. a fable, (which has been published separately as Before the Law) that is meant to explain his situation. K. and the priest discuss the parable. The priest tells K. that the parable is an ancient text of the court, and many generations of court officials have given interpretations. On the eve of K.'s thirty-first birthday, two men arrive at his apartment. He has been waiting for them, and he offers little resistance – indeed the two men take direction from K. as they walk through town. K. leads them to a quarry where the two men place K's head on a discarded block. One of the men produces a double-edged butcher knife, and as the two men pass it back and forth between them, the narrator tells us that ""K. knew then precisely, that it would have been his duty to take the knife...and thrust it into himself."" He does not take the knife. One of the men holds his shoulder and pulls him up and the other man stabs him in the heart and twists the knife twice. K.'s last words are: ""Like a dog!""
","Josef K. was arrested one morning at eight in the morning . He was brought his breakfast by Mrs. Grubach's cook . The ""You should have stayed in your room! Didn't Franz tell you?"" said K. through the open window he noticed the old woman K. was living in a free country, after all, all laws were decent and were upheld . He was always inclined to take life as ""You're under arrest, aren't you?"" says the big policeman . ""You will have to answer them,"" says the police ""You're quite right, but we can't get him to understand a thing,"" says one policeman . ""I don't if nobody believed him, he could bring Mrs. Grubach in as a witness . It puzzled him looking at it from his own ""It's got to be a black coat,"" says one of the policemen . K. threw the coat to the floor ""I daresay you were quite surprised by all that's been taking place this morning,"" says supervisor . ""You're not very surprised ""You're making a big mistake,"" a supervisor says . ""You could be wearing uniforms as proper and exact as you like,"" ""No, I don't want to any more,"" said K., and went over to the window . ""We've got some kind ""I think you'll want to go in to the bank now, won't you?"" asked K., ""I thought I was under arrest K. had left his hat in his room so they all dashed into the room to fetch it . At that moment Mrs. Grubach K. would go to a pub where he would sit at the regulars' table with mostly older men until eleven o'clock . ""A woman's hands will do many things when no-one's looking,"" says Mrs. Grubach . ""I fear I may have ""Don't take it so hard, Mr. K.,"" Mrs. Grubach says . ""I didn't know I was taking it ""Mrs. Grubach, you are on quite the wrong track,"" says Mr. K. ""Thank you, I'll take your word Miss Bürstner's late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and disorder . It was also his fault that  ""I don't want to force my way into any secrets,"" says Miss Bürstner . ""I'm quite happy to forgive ""Yes, there was an investigating committee here,"" says Miss Bürstner . ""You believe that I'm innocent then, do you ""I'm so tired I'm allowing more than I ought to,"" said Miss Bürstner . K. was too  ""You're causing me so much trouble,"" says K., as she sank back onto the cushion, kissed her forehead  I can bear the responsibility for anything that happens in my room myself . But now, please go, leave me alone, I need you to go now K. would have to appear without fail, there was probably no need to point this out to him . It was a matter of course that  K. forced himself to answer, but his thoughts were about how it would be best to get there for nine o'clock in the morning . K. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of time . It was quite far down the street and the gateway K. knocked at flats where doors were closed and asked if Lanz the joiner lived there . It turned out that that was K. thought he had stepped into a meeting . The young woman pointed her wet hand towards the open door of the adjoining room ""You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago,"" the man said . The muttering arose all over the right hand the judge turned to K. with the tone of someone who knows his facts and said, ""you are a house painter?"" ""No,"" said K. sat down very slowly, as if he didn't want anyone to notice . He took out the notebook again, probably ten days ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself is something I laugh about but that's beside the point . There were two police K. broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing . He thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to K. was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they listened to him . There was immediate silence, which showed how well K. K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken ""You bunch of louts,"" K. laughed towards the doorway . ""You can keep all your hearings as a present from ""I've got no protection from him, even my husband has had to get used to it,"" says the woman . ""Do you want to ""You could, for example, show me the books on the table there,"" says the woman . ""Everything is so dirty here,"" says K I'm sure you're very familiar with them and could achieve a great deal through them . Carry on with these people in the same I am glad to endure if I know that each piece of unpleasantness for me is a blow against them . You say these officials are lazy I've got other proof I mean a lot to him, too . He sent me silk stockings, the one he really trust a judge would go to the woman's bed late one night and find it empty because she belonged to K. The student looked away from the K. stroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand . ""This little bastard won't K. watched her without expression like a stranger . He had to accept that the woman had cheated him but that she had also lied ""I know that,"" says the usher as he looks at the student's civilian coat . ""I'm always dreaming of doing ""Well you're facing a charge, aren't you,"" says the usher . ""Only we don't usually get ""They must all be very dispirited,"" says the usher of the court . K. waited for usher, who was following just behind ""I swear on my soul that I've neither submitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort,"" says K. ""Perhaps you don' ""You haven't seen everything yet,"" says the usher ingenuously . ""I don't want to see everything,"" says ""This is your first time is it. It's nothing unusual here, almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time they come here,""  K. looked out between the man and the young woman who were standing in front of him . ""I can't manage it,"" he said Information-giver would have to be elegantly dressed as he constantly has to deal with litigants . ""That's how it is,"" ""Would you not like to sit down here a while?"" asked the information-giver . K. felt almost ashamed to be seen ""Louder,"" he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at having to ask them to speak louder . "" Mrs. Grubach was unable to do anything with her until he had spoken with her . The letters were not returned, but there was no Mrs. Grubach raised her apron to her face and blubbered out loud . ""Oh, don't cry Mrs Miss Bürstner's maid walked up and down the room between the window and the door . Mrs. Grubach looked back Miss Montag said, ""I'm not sure whether you know me"" Miss Montag drew chairs out from the farthest end of the K. was a large man of about forty with a tanned, fleshy face . She exaggerated the importance of K. went to Miss Bürstner's room and knocked gently . K. assumed she was pretending and knocking harder ""Mr. K.! We're to be beaten because you made a complaint about us to the examining judge,"" says Wille ""You shouldn't believe everything they tell you, it's the fear of being beaten,"" says whip-man . ""No, no ""I'm not going to wait any longer,"" says a whip-man . Willem, a policeman, had been quiet K. tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the yard, where a few handcarts had been left behind one another  Franz's claim that his bride was waiting for him was thus shown to be a lie . The policemen were still on K.'s Uncle Karl was K.'s former guardian . ""I'm haunted by a ghost from the country,"" he would ""I have not seen Josef for a long time, I was in the bank last week but Josef was so busy that they would not let ""I don't like the way you're behaving,"" says K.'s uncle . ""The more calm I am, the K.'s uncle was looking out the window, bunching up the curtains with his outstretched hands . ""Now that he ""You could forbid me to leave,"" says his uncle . ""You've completely changed, you used to be so astute, are ""Well, naturally I'll have to think about it,"" says K. ""you must bear in mind that I've been living in the country ""Dr. Huld is unwell,"" said K.'s uncle . ""I think it is, sir,"" said the girl  ""I don't believe it is. It's just as much trouble as it's ever been,"" says K.'s uncle . K.'s uncle jumped up as if he had just been stabbed . ""You damned ...,"" he ""Perhaps I've been going too fast. What was it you wanted to speak to me about? I thought it was to do with your ""You took us by surprise, you see,"" says the office director . ""I'm afraid I'll only be able to stay  K.'s uncle served as a candle-bearer, balancing the candle on his thigh . The office director was ""You didn't really look like you could be won over in one stroke,"" says Leni . ""That's not it,"" says ""You're too unyielding, that's what I've heard,"" says Leni . ""You understand a ""I don't like her, she's clumsy and crude,"" says Leni . ""You can't think ""You slip off with some dirty, little thing who, moreover, is obviously the lawyer's beloved, and stay away for hours,"" he K. had no idea what actions the lawyer was taking; it was certainly not a lot, it was more than a month since the lawyer summon K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no The lawyers' room is on the second floor of the attic . if your foot does go through it will hang down into the first floor of the only things of real value are honest personal contacts, contacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower grades, you understand . There are junior officials are irritated and often express themselves about the litigants in unflattering ways . They're only allowed to deal with lawyers gathered together in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do . on the one hand they had actually no right to be It's not that the accused takes the case away from him, that hardly ever happens, once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer The trial will have entered a stage where no more help can be given, where it's being processed in courts to which no-one has any if K. had come to him at the right time, it would have been a bad time to put them in, he would object  K. had not been submitted even though the trial had already lasted several months . he could be surprised with the verdict, or at least with a week or so before, he could only have felt shame at the thought of being made to write out such documents himself . the deputy director K. was a short, jolly man, a manufacturer who knew well . He apologised for disturbing K. at some K. stopped talking, nodded at each of the manufacturer's louder exclamations for a short while . But eventually he stopped K. still had enough control of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his friendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer . if he was to conduct his defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to the court . What would his life be like in ""I'm very sorry if it's something that'll be a burden to you today of all days,"" a manufacturer says  ""I know about your case through a certain Titorelli. He's just his artistic name, I don't even know what his Mr. K. the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer . If you want to go and see Titorelli, then it'll certainly a number of doubts of a sort he had never before known had affected his own vigilance . Now that the servit ""I have to go out on some business,"" said K. The deputy director . ""We've already come to an understanding,"" says K. K. was going out of the bank on a business matter . He went straight to the painter who lived in an outlying part of Titorelli was a painter who had taken on the role of leader . The hunchbacked girl clapped her ""You seem to be very popular in this building,"" painter says . ""Those kids are a real burden for me,"" he says  ""I learned about you from this gentleman, an acquaintance of yours, and it's on his advice that I've come here,"" says the ""You've painted the figure as it actually appears on the throne,"" says the painter . ""That's what the judge ""I take it you must be a trustee of the court,"" the painter says . ""You want to learn something about the court, like ""I must have warmth. And it is very cosy here, isn't it. This room's very good in that respect,"" says ""It's very hard to make it think otherwise,"" said K. to himself, forgetting that he had only gone there to investigate the ""Only impossible for reasons and proofs you take to the court yourself,"" says the painter . ""You are to be envied,"" says ""I forgot to ask you: what sort of acquittal is it you want,"" says the painter . ""I think you' ""I've never seen a single acquittal,"" says the painter . ""I don't suppose it's possible K. now realised that all this time he had been hoping the painter would suddenly go over to the window and pull it open . "" ""It's up to you which one you choose,"" says the painter . ""That would be very kind of you,"" says K. The right to acquit people is a major privilege and our judges don't have it, but they do have the right to free people ""But this second acquittal will once again not be final,"" says K., shaking his head . ""You clearly don't I don't mean that the defendant is never free, he's never free in the proper sense of the word with an apparent ac ""I'll buy them both and hang them in my office,"" says the painter . ""Will you open this door for me,"" says Cum beggar was not in the mood to hear about the professional experiences of this painter . ""I expect I can find a porter for K. had the pictures taken to his office and locked them in the lowest drawer of his desk . It was impossible to remove his doubts as to K. pressed on the button for the second time he looked back at the other door . At last, two eyes appeared at the spy- ""I remember now,"" said the businessman as he lowered the candle, ""that's what I've already been told"" K. ""I want you to explain everything to you,"" says Leni . ""You're not going to be jealous of Mr. Block now, ""The only worry then is that he might go to sleep soon after he's eaten,"" says K. ""Just go,"" she whispere ""He can be so vindictive, you see,"" says the businessman . ""I'm not sure I should tell you about it,"" ""What a coincidence that is!"" exclaimed K., totally engrossed and forgetting how ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him ""They don't normally have much contact with each other,"" says the businessman . ""I saw those gentlemen in the waiting room,"" says ""I still remember it exactly,"" a businessman says . ""My case"" didn't move on at all, there were some hearings rumours about my trial started to spread among some of the people I do business with . So I went to the lawyer and complained about it ""You were about to tell me about my trial,"" said Leni, twitching with impatience . ""You wanted immediate results ""He often sleeps here,"" exclaimed Leni . ""You take it far too much for granted, what your friends do for you,"" ""He's only pretending to mind,"" says businessman Leni . ""You've forgotten your promise,"" he says . ""I find that quite acceptable,"" says K. The lawyer looked at him quizzically . ""It seemed to me that you locked the door ""Do I understand you rightly?"" asked the lawyer as he half raised himself in his bed and supported himself with one hand on the pillow . ""Thank you for feeling so friendly toward me,"" says lawyer . ""I see,"" says attorney, ""you've become impatient"" ""I despite all that he held on tightly to K. Why? Was it something personal for his uncle's sake or did he really see K ""I will make one more attempt,"" says the lawyer as if whatever had been making K. so annoyed . ""Be glad to,"" says K ""You always come at a bad time,"" says Block, a friend of mine . ""Well you're here now,"" says the lawyer ""You can kneel down or creep on all fours, whatever you like. I won't bother with you any more,"" says Block . ""I'm kneeling now, Dr. Huld, sir,"" says Block, as if speaking to himself to give himself courage  K. could not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance would win him over . He was no longer a client, he was the ""I don't think his case is lost yet,"" says Block's lawyer . ""You're letting him abuse you,' says You should be ashamed of yourself here in front of my client! And you're destroying the trust he has for me . You know that It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K. arrived early at seven o'clock in the office . he was asked a servitor came in and reported that the director had sent him to see if the chief clerk was already in his office . K. K. had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watched the exchange between the two men . After taking his leave from the director he turned to K. spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary, copying out obscure words he would need to guide the Italian round the cathedral  K. hurried along both side naves but saw no-one but an old woman staring up at a picture of the Virgin Mary  It was a long time since K. had looked at any pictures and he studied the knight . Then when he moved the light to K. followed the old man all the way up the side nave and almost as far as the main altar .

Pride and Prejudice," The narrative opens with Mr Bingley, a wealthy, charming and social young bachelor, moving into Netherfield Park in the neighbourhood of the Bennet family. Mr Bingley is soon well received, while his friend Mr Darcy makes a less favorable first impression by appearing proud and condescending at a ball that they attend (this is partly explained in that he detests dancing and is not much for light conversation). Mr Bingley singles out Elizabeth's elder sister, Jane, for particular attention, and it soon becomes apparent that they have formed an attachment to each other. By contrast, Darcy slights Elizabeth, who overhears and jokes about it despite feeling a budding resentment. On paying a visit to Mr Bingley's sister, Jane is caught in a heavy downpour, catches cold, and is forced to stay at Netherfield for several days. Elizabeth arrives to nurse her sister and is thrown into frequent company with Mr Darcy, who begins to perceive his attachment to her, but is too proud to proceed on this feeling. Mr Collins, a clergyman, pays a visit to the Bennets. Mr Bennet and Elizabeth are much amused by his obsequious veneration of his employer, the noble Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as well as by his self-important and pedantic nature. It soon becomes apparent that Mr Collins has come to Longbourn to choose a wife from among the Bennet sisters (his cousins) and Elizabeth has been singled out. At the same time, Elizabeth forms an acquaintance with Mr Wickham, a militia officer who claims to have been very seriously mistreated by Mr Darcy, despite having been a ward of Mr Darcy's father. This tale, and Elizabeth's attraction to Mr Wickham, adds fuel to her dislike of Mr Darcy. At a ball given by Mr Bingley at Netherfield, Mr Darcy becomes aware of a general expectation that Mr Bingley and Jane will marry, and the Bennet family, with the exception of Jane and Elizabeth, make a public display of poor manners and decorum. The following morning, Mr Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth, who refuses him, much to her mother's distress. Mr Collins recovers and promptly becomes engaged to Elizabeth's close friend Charlotte, a homely woman with few prospects. Mr Bingley abruptly quits Netherfield and returns to London, and Elizabeth is convinced that Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley's sister have conspired to separate him from Jane. In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are frequently invited to Rosings Park, home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy's aunt; coincidentally, Darcy also arrives to visit. Darcy again finds himself attracted to Elizabeth and impetuously proposes to her. Elizabeth, however, has just learned of Darcy's role in separating Mr Bingley from Jane from his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam. She angrily rebukes him, and a heated discussion follows; she charges him with destroying her sister's happiness, with treating Mr Wickham disgracefully, and with having conducted himself towards her in an ungentleman-like manner. Mr Darcy, shocked, ultimately responds with a letter giving a good account of (most of) his actions: Wickham had exchanged his legacies for a cash payment, only to return after gambling away the money to reclaim the forfeited inheritance; he then attempted to elope with Darcy's young sister, thereby to capture her fortune. Regarding Mr Bingley and Jane, Darcy claimed he had observed no reciprocal interest in Jane for Bingley. Elizabeth later came to acknowledge the truth of Darcy's assertions. Some months later, Elizabeth and her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate, believing he will be absent for the day. He returns unexpectedly, and though surprised, he is gracious and welcoming. He treats the Gardiners with great civility; he introduces Elizabeth to his sister, and Elizabeth begins to realise her attraction to him. Their reacquaintance is cut short, however, by news that Lydia, Elizabeth's sister, has run away to elope with Mr Wickham. Elizabeth and the Gardiners return to Longbourn, where Elizabeth grieves that her renewed acquaintance with Mr Darcy will end because of her sister's disgrace. Lydia and Wickham are soon found, then married by the clergy; they visit Longbourn, where Lydia lets slip that Mr Darcy was responsible for finding the couple and negotiating their marriage—at great expense to himself. Elizabeth is shocked but does not dwell further on the topic due to Mr Bingley's return and subsequent proposal to Jane, who immediately accepts. Lady Catherine de Bourgh later bursts in on Longbourn; intending to thwart local rumour, she warns Elizabeth against marrying Mr Darcy. Elizabeth refuses her demands. Disgusted, Lady Catherine leaves and drops by to inform her nephew on Elizabeth's abominable behaviour. However, this lends hope to Darcy that Elizabeth's opinion of him may have changed. He travels to Longbourn and proposes again; and now Elizabeth accepts.

A Tale of Two Cities," Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Lucie Manette travel to Saint Antoine, a suburb of Paris, and meet Monsieur Defarge and Madame Defarge. The Defarges operate a wine shop they use to lead a clandestine band of revolutionaries; they refer to each other by the codename ""Jacques,"" which Charles Dickens drew from the Jacobins, an actual French revolutionary group. Monsieur Defarge was Doctor Manette's servant before his incarceration, and now takes care of him, so he takes them to see the doctor. Because of his long imprisonment, Doctor Manette entered a form of psychosis and has become obsessed with making shoes, a trade he had learned while in prison. At first, he does not recognise his daughter; but he eventually compares her long golden hair with her mother's, a strand of which he found on his sleeve when he was incarcerated and kept, and notices their identical blue eye colour. Mr. Lorry and Miss Manette then take him back to England. Five years later, two British spies, John Barsad and Roger Cly, are trying to frame French émigré Charles Darnay for their own gain; and Darnay is on trial for treason at the Old Bailey. They claim, falsely, that Darnay gave information about British troops in North America to the French. Darnay is acquitted, however, when a witness who claims he would be able to recognise Darnay anywhere is unable to tell Darnay apart from a barrister present in court, Sydney Carton, who looks almost identical to him. In Paris, a wheel on the despised Marquis St. Evrémonde's carriage hits and kills the baby of a peasant, Gaspard. The Marquis throws a coin to Gaspard to compensate him for his loss. Defarge, a witness to the incident, comforts Gaspard. As the Marquis's coach drives off, the coin thrown to Gaspard is thrown back into the coach by an unknown hand, probably that of Madame Defarge, enraging the Marquis. Arriving at his château, the Marquis meets with his nephew and heir, Darnay. (Out of disgust with his family, Darnay shed his real surname and adopted an Anglicised version of his mother's maiden name, D'Aulnais.) The following scene demonstrates the differences between Darnay's personality and his uncle's: Darnay has sympathy for the peasantry, while the Marquis is cruel and heartless: ""Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,"" observed the Marquis, ""will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,"" looking up to it, ""shuts out the sky."" That night, Gaspard, who followed the Marquis to his château by riding on the underside of the carriage, stabs and kills the Marquis in his sleep. He leaves a note on the knife saying, &#34;Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from JACQUES.&#34; After nine months on the run, he is caught, and hanged above the village&#39;s fountain, poisoning its water, which angers the peasants greatly. In London, Darnay gets Dr. Manette&#39;s permission to wed Lucie; but Carton confesses his love to Lucie as well. Knowing she will not love him in return, Carton promises to &#34;embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you&#34;. On the morning of the marriage, Darnay reveals his real name and who his family is, a detail which Dr. Manette had asked him to withhold until then. This unhinges Dr. Manette, who reverts to his obsessive shoemaking. His sanity is restored before Lucie returns from her honeymoon and the whole incident kept secret from her. To prevent a further relapse, Lorry and Miss Pross destroy the shoemaking bench and tools, which Dr. Manette had brought with him from Paris. It is 14 July 1789. The Defarges help to lead the storming of the Bastille. Defarge enters Dr. Manette&#39;s former cell, &#34;One Hundred and Five, North Tower&#34;. The reader does not know what Monsieur Defarge is searching for until Book 3, Chapter 9. It is a statement in which Dr. Manette explains why he was imprisoned. As time passes in England, Lucie and Charles begin to raise a family, a son (who dies in childhood) and a daughter, little Lucie. The perennial bachelor Lorry, who believes that such things are beyond &#34;a man of business&#34;, finds a second home and a sort of family with the Darnays. Stryver, who once had intentions to marry Lucie, marries a rich widow with three children and becomes even more insufferable as his ambitions begin to be realised. Carton, even though he seldom visits, is accepted as a close friend of the family and becomes a special favourite of little Lucie. Darnay, being called by a former servant who has been unjustly imprisoned, decides to come back to France to free him. But shortly after his arrival, he is denounced for being an emigrated aristocrat from France and imprisoned in La Force Prison in Paris. Dr. Manette and Lucie—along with Miss Pross, Jerry Cruncher, and &#34;Little Lucie&#34;, the daughter of Charles and Lucie Darnay—come to Paris and meet Mr. Lorry to try to free Darnay. A year and three months pass, and Darnay is finally tried. Dr. Manette, who is seen as a hero for his imprisonment in the hated Bastille, is able to have him released; but, that same evening, Darnay is again arrested. He is put on trial again the following day, under new charges brought by the Defarges and one &#34;unnamed other&#34;. We soon discover that this &#34;other&#34; is Dr. Manette, through his own account of his imprisonment. Manette did not know that his statement had been found and is horrified when his words are used to condemn Darnay. On an errand, Miss Pross is amazed to see her long-lost brother, Solomon Pross; but Solomon does not want to be recognised. Sydney Carton suddenly steps forward from the shadows much as he had done after Darnay&#39;s first trial in London and identifies Solomon Pross as John Barsad, one of the men who tried to frame Darnay for treason at the Old Bailey trial. Carton threatens to reveal Solomon&#39;s identity as a Briton and an opportunist who spies for the French or the British as it suits him. If this were revealed, Solomon would surely be executed, so Carton&#39;s hand is strong. Darnay is confronted at the tribunal by Monsieur Defarge, who identifies Darnay as the Marquis St. Evrémonde and reads the letter Dr. Manette had hidden in his cell in the Bastille. Defarge can identify Darnay as Evrémonde because Barsad told him Darnay&#39;s identity when Barsad was fishing for information at the Defarges&#39; wine shop in Book 2, Chapter 16. The letter describes how Dr. Manette was locked away in the Bastille by Darnay&#39;s father and his uncle for trying to report their crimes against a peasant family. Darnay&#39;s uncle had become infatuated with a girl, whom he had kidnapped and raped. Despite Dr. Manette&#39;s attempts to save her, she died. The uncle then killed her husband by working him to death. Before he died defending the family honour, the brother of the raped peasant had hidden the last member of the family, his younger sister. The letter also reveals that Dr. Manette was imprisoned because the Evrémonde brothers discovered that they could not bribe him to keep quiet. The paper concludes by condemning the Evrémondes, &#34;them and their descendants, to the last of their race&#34;. Dr. Manette is horrified, but his protests are ignored—he is not allowed to take back his condemnation. Darnay is sent to the Conciergerie and sentenced to be guillotined the next day. Carton wanders into the Defarges&#39; wine shop, where he overhears Madame Defarge talking about her plans to have the rest of Darnay&#39;s family (Lucie and &#34;Little Lucie&#34;) condemned. Carton discovers that Madame Defarge was the surviving sister of the peasant family savaged by the Evrémondes. The only plot detail that might give one any sympathy for Madame Defarge is the loss of her family and that she has no (family) name. Defarge is her married name, and Dr. Manette does not know her family name, though he asked her dying sister for it. At night, when Dr. Manette returns shattered after spending the day in many failed attempts to save Charles&#39; life, he has reverted to his obsessive search for his shoemaking implements. Carton urges Lorry to flee Paris with Lucie, her father, and Little Lucie, &#34;as soon as his, i.e Carton&#39;s place in the coach is filled&#34;. That same morning, Carton visits Darnay in prison. Carton drugs Darnay, and Barsad (whom Carton is blackmailing) has Darnay carried out of the prison. Carton has decided to pretend to be Darnay and to be executed in his place. He does this out of love for Lucie, recalling his earlier promise to her. Following Carton&#39;s earlier instructions, Darnay&#39;s family and Lorry flee Paris and France. In their coach is an unconscious man who carries Carton&#39;s identification papers, but is actually Darnay. Meanwhile, Madame Defarge, armed with a pistol, goes to the residence of Lucie&#39;s family, hoping to catch them mourning for Darnay, since it was illegal to mourn an enemy of the Republic; however, Lucie and Little Lucie, Dr. Manette, and Mr. Lorry are already gone. To give them time to escape, Miss Pross confronts Madame Defarge and they struggle. Pross speaks only English and Defarge speaks only French, so neither can understand what the other is saying but each instinctively understands the other&#39;s intentions. In the struggle, Madame Defarge&#39;s pistol goes off, killing her; the noise of the shot and the shock of Madame Defarge&#39;s death cause Miss Pross to go permanently deaf. The novel concludes with the guillotining of Sydney Carton. As he is waiting to board the tumbril, he is approached by a seamstress, also condemned to death, who mistakes him for Darnay but, upon getting close, realises the truth. Awed by his unselfish courage and sacrifice, she asks to stay close to him and he agrees. Upon their arrival at the guillotine, she and Carton are the last two and Carton comforts her, telling her that their ends will be quick but that there is no Time or Trouble &#34;in the better land where ... [they] will be mercifully sheltered&#34;, and she is able to meet her death in peace. Carton&#39;s unspoken last thoughts are prophetic: ""I see Barsad, ... Defarge, The Vengeance [a lieutenant of Madame Defarge], ... long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out. &#34;I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man [Mr. Lorry], so long their friend, in ten years&#39; time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward. ""I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul, than I was in the souls of both. &#34;I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place—then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day&#39;s disfigurement—and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice. ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."" Lucie and Darnay have a first son earlier in the book who is born and dies within a single paragraph; it seems likely that this first son appears in the novel so that their later son, named after Carton, can represent another way in which Carton restores Lucie and Darnay through his sacrifice.

Oblomov," The novel evolved and expanded from an 1849 short story or sketch entitled ""Oblomov's Dream. An Episode from an Unfinished Novel"", later incorporated as ""Oblomov's Dream"" (""Son Oblomova"") as Chapter 9 in the completed 1859 novel. The novel focuses on the midlife crisis of the main character, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, an upper middle class son of a member of Russia's nineteenth century landed gentry. Oblomov's distinguishing characteristic is his slothful attitude towards life. While a common negative characteristic, Oblomov raises this trait to an art form, conducting his little daily business apathetically from his bed. While clearly comedic, the novel also seriously examines many critical issues that faced Russian society in the nineteenth century. Some of these problems included the uselessness of landowners and gentry in a feudal society that did not encourage innovation or reform, the complex relations between members of different classes of society such as Oblomov's relationship with his servant Zakhar, and courtship and matrimony by the elite. An excerpt from Oblomov's morning (from the beginning of the novel): :Therefore he did as he had decided; and when the tea had been consumed he raised himself upon his elbow and arrived within an ace of getting out of bed. In fact, glancing at his slippers, he even began to extend a foot in their direction, but presently withdrew it. :Half-past ten struck, and Oblomov gave himself a shake. ""What is the matter?,"" he said vexedly. ""In all conscience 'tis time that I were doing something! Would I could make up my mind to—to—"" He broke off with a shout of ""Zakhar!"" whereupon there entered an elderly man in a grey suit and brass buttons—a man who sported beneath a perfectly bald pate a pair of long, bushy, grizzled whiskers that would have sufficed to fit out three ordinary men with beards. His clothes, it is true, were cut according to a country pattern, but he cherished them as a faint reminder of his former livery, as the one surviving token of the dignity of the house of Oblomov. The house of Oblomov was one which had once been wealthy and distinguished, but which, of late years, had undergone impoverishment and diminution, until finally it had become lost among a crowd of noble houses of more recent creation. :For a few moments Oblomov remained too plunged in thought to notice Zakhar's presence; but at length the valet coughed. :""What do you want?"" Oblomov inquired. :""You called me just now, master?"" :""I called you, you say? Well, I cannot remember why I did so. Return to your room until I have remembered."" Oblomov spends the first part of the book in bed or lying on his sofa. He receives a letter from the manager of his country estate explaining that the financial situation is deteriorating and that he must visit the estate to make some major decisions, but Oblomov can barely leave his bedroom, much less journey a thousand miles into the country. A flashback reveals a good deal of why Oblomov is so slothful; the reader sees Oblomov's upbringing in the country village of Oblomovka. He is spoiled rotten and never required to work or perform household duties, and he is constantly pulled from school for vacations and trips or for trivial reasons. In contrast, his friend Andrey Stoltz, born to a German father and a Russian mother, is raised in a strict, disciplined environment, reflecting Goncharov's own view of the European mentality as dedicated and hard-working. As the story develops, Stoltz introduces Oblomov to a young woman, Olga, and the two fall in love. However, his apathy and fear of moving forward are too great, and she calls off their engagement when it is clear that he will keep delaying their wedding to avoid having to take basic steps like putting his affairs in order. :""Shall I tell you what you would have done had we married?"" at length she said. ""Day by day you would have relapsed farther and farther into your slough. And I? You see what I am—that I am not yet grown old, and that I shall never cease to live. But you would have taken to waiting for Christmas, and then for Shrovetide, and to attending evening parties, and to dancing, and to thinking of nothing at all. You would have retired to rest each night with a sigh of thankfulness that the day had passed so quickly; and each morning you would have awakened with a prayer that to-day might be exactly as yesterday. That would have been our future. Is it not so? Meanwhile I should have been fading away. Do you really think that in such a life you would have been happy?"" :He tried to rise and leave the room, but his feet refused their office. He tried to say something, but his throat seemed dry, and no sound would come. All he could do was to stretch out his hand. :""Forgive me!"" he murmured. :She too tried to speak, but could not. She too tried to extend her hand, but it fell back. Finally, her face contracted painfully, and, sinking forward upon his shoulder, she burst into a storm of sobbing. It was as though all her weapons had slipped from her grasp, and once more she was just a woman—a woman defenceless in her fight with sorrow. :""Good-bye, good-bye!"" she said amid her spasms of weeping. He sat listening painfully to her sobs, but felt as though he could say nothing to check them. Sinking into a chair, and burying her face in her handkerchief, she wept bitter, burning tears, with her head bowed upon the table. :""Olga,"" at length he said, ""why torture yourself in this way? You love me, and could never survive a parting. Take me, therefore, as I am, and love in me just so much as may be worthy of it."" :Without raising her head, she made a gesture of refusal. During this period, Oblomov is swindled repeatedly by his ""friend"" Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich, his landlady's brother, and Stoltz has to undo the damage each time. The last time, Oblomov ends up living in penury because Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich are blackmailing him out of all of his income from the country estate, which lasts for over a year before Stoltz discovers the situation and reports Ivan Matveyevich to his supervisor. Olga leaves Russia and visits Paris, where she bumps into Stoltz on the street. The two strike up a romance and end up marrying. However, not even Oblomov could go through life without at least one moment of self-possession and purpose. When Taranteyev's behavior at last reaches insufferable lows, Oblomov confronts him, slaps him around a bit and finally kicks him out of the house, in a scene in which all the noble traits that his social class was supposed to symbolize shine through his then worn out being. Oblomov has a child with his widowed landlady, Agafia Pshenitsina, but they never marry. They name the child Andrey, after Stoltz, who adopts the boy upon Oblomov's death. Oblomov spends the rest of his life in a second Oblomovka, being taken care of by Agafia Pshenitsina like he used to be as a child. She can prepare many a succulent meal, and makes sure that Oblomov doesn't have a single worrisome thought. Sometime before his death he had been visited by Stoltz, who had promised to his wife a last attempt at bringing Oblomov back to the world, but without success. By then Oblomov had already accepted his fate, and during the conversation he mentions ""Oblomovitis"" as the real cause of his demise. Oblomov's end is quiet, much like the rest of his life.

He was neither handsome nor ugly, neither tall nor short, neither fair nor fair “What is the matter with you?” asked Alexiev suddenly . “Only this moment you said we would go and lunch at Ovchinin’s, and then proceed to the Ekaterin Mikhei Andreievitch Tarantiev was a native of the same district as Oblomov . He did not believe in refinement of costume, nor was in any way ashamed of the fact “You use the plain stuff, and not the French, do you? Why not use the French,” said Alexiev, opening his snuffbox . “You have come too early in the “I have met with two misfortunes,” said Tarantiev . “In the first place, I am to be turned out of this fiat.” “Because you haven’ _starosta's_ is a robber . If I were there I’d teach him! Do you suppose this letter to be a natural, an honest one? No, no he passed in review certain grave and fundamental schemes affecting his plough-land and its taxation . After which he elaborated a new and stricter course to be taken against laziness Oblomov’s features blushed with delight at the vision . He pictured to himself a small colony of friends who should come and settle in the villages and farms within a radius of fifteen Oblomov shook his head despondently, bowed his bald pate, and subsided into profound meditation . “The truth is, I had to visit a neighbour of your ""Oh, very well. I have merely been warning you,"" said Oblomov . Try, rather, to divert yourself with riding, dancing, with moderate exercise in the open air, and with pleasant V We find ourselves transported to a land where neither sea nor mountains nor crags nor precipices nor lonely forests exist . Oblomov sank asleep; and as he slept Ever since the world began, those waves have voiced but the querulous lament of a monster which, everlastingly doomed to torment, utters a chorus of shri Winter, like a cold, unapproachable beauty, retains her character until the lawful season of thaw has arrived . In November, there begin snow and frost which, towards the Oblomov’s dream no one knows such a moon; there Luna’s features, as she looks down upon the villages and the fields, resembles, rather, a polished, cheery copper the quails are a bird, and therefore legally prohibited from being used for food . in almost every house there hangs a wicker cage wherein a member of that feathered species No man has ever strayed beyond his own circle, for the local inhabitants dwell far from other men, and both the nearest village and the nearest country town lie distant from twenty-five to thirty versts  In the past five years not a single soul of that local population has died either a violent death or a natural . In the same way, after the trader Tarass had come near to Oblomov dreamed that, aged seven, he awoke in his little cot at home . He felt merry and full of life, with cheeks of such rotundity Ilya Ilyitch, the little one of Oblomov's parents, was the owner of seven serfs . The nurse caught hold of the child, and started to heap him with cares “God bless the child!” exclaimed the nurse. “_Will_ you be quiet, then, young sir? You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” The child was not always mischievous  Oblomov's wife, Ignashka, was fully employed by the tailor for three hours . Averka, the tailor, was always there to see that the cows were properly watere a maid was dispatched to the culinary regions to remind the cook of this, or to instruct her to change the other, while conveying to her sugar, honey, and wine for flavouring . a thousand-year-old vessel was sultry, and not a cloud was in the sky . Even the house was possessed by a silence as of death, for the hour of post Oblomov had been impatiently awaiting, for it marked the beginning of an independent existence . On tiptoe he left the nurse’s side, and peeping cautiously at the other Awakened, she sprang up, straightened the cap on her head, arranged her grey curls with one finger, and pretended never to have been to sleep at all . Soon from The hour of nature’s most solemn, all-embracing silence had arrived . The hour when the creative brain can work at its best, and when the heart flames with the greatest heat of passion  Oblomovka dreamed of a second dream: Glory, O Lord, to Thee this night . The nurse said there dwelt there a kind witch who sometimes revealed herself to mortal Oblomov's nurse told the boy of cruel robbers, of sleeping princesses, and of cities and peoples which had been turned into stone . With a simplicity, yet a navely surprised at or overcome with terror by the evils and misfortunes which befell them, and resorted for the causes of these things to the dim, dumb hier Oblomovka's belief in supernatural phenomena vanished, but there remained behind a sediment of terror and unaccountable sadness . In the next dream he saw himself a boy of Schtoltz kept a small educational establishment for the sons of neighbouring gentry . He had a son of his own--one Andrei, a boy almost of the same age Oblomovka folk had no belief in disturbing the mind; they never adopted as their mode of life a round of ceaseless aspirations somewhither, and towards an indefinite end .  Oblomov’s vision was followed by a varied procession of minor incidents of life, whether grave or gay--of baptisms, birthdays, family festivals, Shrovetides, Easters a funeral ceremony interrupted the festivities, but not for long, since other faces would appear to succeed the old ones . So life stretched out in a continuous, uniform chain which broke off imperceptibly only Luka _must_ have been a good workman, but they were capable of being shaken out of their apathy, even to the point of growing angry and heated . At once due Oblomovka's 'contretemps' was a practice which had arisen partly from custom and partly from economy . he disliked disbursing hard cash; so much so the Oblomovkans paid out from two to five hundred roubles for a given purpose, however necessary that purpose might be, seemed to the inhabitants of the establishment something almost approaching suicide .  In his dream Oblomov saw an evening spent in this manner, but whole weeks and months and years of such evening’s . It was not uncommon for the incident to give rise to a lengthy conversation  the Oblomovkans gathered in corners to relate of what they had dreamed during the previous night . had their dreams been unpleasant, the company at once became thoughtful and nervous, and refrained from Old Oblomov took the letter, and turned it over in his hands, as though at a loss what to do with the epistle . The first time they came, I kept quiet, and Old Oblomov started to read the letter aloud . It seemed that Philip Matveitch wanted him to forward the recipe for a certain beer . “Then send it, send it,” ex Ilya was indifferent to the identity of a book, since he looked upon such articles as mere instruments of distraction from _ennui_ and lack of employment . Also, he would read Oblomovka's parents were not blind to the value of education; it was that they realized only its _external_ value . some evil rumours had arisen regarding the necessity Zakhar grew up slowly and drowsily, and in a way which turned his energies inwards, and gradually caused them to wither . At length the thing was no longer PART II I Often Oblomov’s old school friend had endeavoured to wean his comrade from the state of inertia in which he (Oblomov) was Oblomovstchina_ is a smithery, not life . To stand still would mean sweeping away, not only from his chamber walls, but also from his eyes, the cob Tarantiev's flat was to be removed to the quarters of his crony in the Veaborg Quarter . But Oblomov continued to send him letter after letter, but they remained On the evening of the fateful dinner-party at the aunt’s house, Oblomov experienced the same torture during the meal as he had done on the previous occasion . At no point did he I will tell her, in so many words, that her eyes are dragging my very soul out of my body.” He handed her a chair, and she took a seat beside him . “I want “Why did you speak for me at all?” protested Oblomov . “I am by no means an adorer of music.” “Why, the man is offended! I introduce him as Oblomov, a friend of Schtoltz’s, was powerless to sleep . He paced the room in a mood of thoughtful despondency, and at dawn left the house “You can do that by singing to me again.” “Ah, I was expecting that compliment!” The words came from her in a sudden burst as of pleasure . “Do you know, had Olga plied him with a particular question or another, and demanded of him . At times a given question would absorb her even to the point of forgetting her consideration for Oblomov I feel lost without you; to be parted from you for a long while makes me sad; and, were you to die, I should wear mourning for the rest of my life, and never again be 'Life is a duty which must be fulfilled as such,' says Olga . 'No, I cannot visit him to-day,' he said . ""Is she not I am the subject, for the reason that I chanced to be the first subject to come to hand.” So he collated the circumstances, and compared them . Never would she have noticed him at all “You are weeping?” he replied, while her form shook with sobs . “The sight of it will only make me weep more bitterly,” he said . Suppose that, fearing no rival, you were to go to sleep by my side (as you do on your sofa at home), and your dressing-gown came to acquire more value in your eyes than “I am going abroad.” “What is more, the sooner you hand over to me a half-year’s rent, the better,” retorted Tarantiev coolly . “ a wedding ceremony, a journey to Oblomovka, an application to the local council, the laying out of roads, an endless transaction of business with peasants, and so forth . Oblomovka wishes for ever to be on the move, or losing herself in reveries .

Zakhar said nothing, but eyed him with a sidelong glance . “You Ilya Ilyitch or Peter Petrovitch ranks only as the _zhenich . Every day other folk will call upon him with their faces reduced to an even greater state of imbecility Oblomov checked himself abruptly . He felt horrified to think of the threatening, the uncomfortable, vision which his imagination conjured up . In seeking to overawe Zakhar,  “Are you coming to our house to-morrow?” she asked . “Already she has divined my thoughts, and knows that I do not want to come!” “Yes, yes,”  I Let us depart as quickly as possible. You must come to-morrow. Do you hear? What have we not come to! It is all Schtoltz’s fault. He shed love over So much did the idea gam upon her that she passed a sleepless night, and rose pale, quiet, and determined . The landlady informed Oblomov that a visitor wanted to see “Let us decide to tell my aunt this week,” she replied . “There is more in this than meets the eye. Tell me all that is in your mind. What does it mean?” she asked  ""I feel like a machine, I walk and act without knowing ever what I am doing,"" he reflected . ""Then marriage is not to be thought of for at least another year,"" Olg “Do not torture me, Olga,” he cried with weariness in his tone . “Then am I right in what I suppose?” she asked. “Yes--you are right,” Oblomov’s legs were tottering under him, wiped his hands and forehead with his handkerchief . The words had been harsh--they had stung him to the quick  PART IV I For many a day after his illness Oblomov’s mood was one of dull and painful despondency; but gradually this became replaced with a phase of mute indif “I am not the man I then was. I have now set my affairs in order, and my plans for improving my estate are nearly finished,” asked Schtoltz . “You know the story, Oblomov has not forgotten you, and, I think, never will . She is not the sort of person to forget you, he said . ""You and I are of different types,"" said O Zakhar was more seedy and untidy than ever . He had about him a pinched and hungry air, as though his appetite was bad . The landlady entered to Oblomov: You have relieved my soul of a great burden, and all within it is bright . You have never forgotten you, for you would have been worthy of her, you who have a Olga Schtoltz departed for the Crimea after a long sojourn in the capital . She shook her soul clear of this despondency, and quickened her steps Is this _really_ all--all? She would scan the earth, the heavens, and the wilds, yet find therein no answer, but merely gloom, profundity “No, I am not _ennuyée_,” Olga dully replied . “You are a difficult man to conceal things from,” she replied gravely . Sometimes such depression ""I am at a loss what to say. You are too full of life and hitherto been maturing,"" she said . ""I cannot bear it when you go muttering to yourself like Frequently the growings of a vivid, excitable intellect transcend the limits of everyday existence, and become converted into despondency and a temporary dissatisfaction with life . True, such In this case, however, there is no fear of that. Your trouble is not peculiar to you alone . Invariably does a human being feel lost when he or she breaks away from life . Olga was struck with the mournful foreboding in his tone . But she trusted him implicitly--his voice alone inspired in her belief . She paced the avenue slowly and mechanically 'Tis an honourable, trustworthy heart. He ought to be treated firmly, be removed from his rooms and taken away,' she asked half-jestingly .

Show Boat," The time is the late nineteenth century. Captain Andy Hawks is a former riverboat owner with a shrewish wife, Parthy Ann, and a ten-year-old daughter, Magnolia. He buys the new show boat Cotton Blossom. Among the actors are Julie Dozier and her husband Steve Baker, and Ellie Chipley and her husband, affectionately known as ""Schultzy"". Other members of the crew are Pete, the engineer of the towboat Mollie Able, which propels the show boat; Frank the utility man, and Windy McClain, the pilot. Steve and Julie are close, and Julie becomes Magnolia's best friend, showing motherly affection toward her. For a time, all is well, but soon Pete begins making unwanted advances toward Julie. He gets into a fist fight with Steve, is soundly beaten, and swears revenge. He implies knowing some dark secret concerning Julie. When the troupe arrives at Lemoyne, Mississippi, Pete steals Julie's picture from the box office and takes it to the local sheriff. Julie claims she does not feel well enough to perform, and Parthy observes that Julie fell sick the year before in the same town. When they hear what Pete has done, Steve takes out a pocket knife, makes a cut on Julie's hand, and sucks blood from it. The sheriff arrives and announces that there is a miscegenation case on board: since Julie is black and Steve is white, their marriage is illegal. Julie admits that she is half-black. Ellie, who has been very close to Julie, becomes upset at the revelation and hysterically denounces her friend. Steve says he has ""negro blood"" in him, and the rest of the company backs him up. The sheriff, not realizing that Steve's claim is based only on his having sucked some blood from Julie's hand (this refers to social conventions classifying as black anyone with known African ancestry), believes he cannot arrest the couple and leaves. He tells Steve and Julie to leave the boat, which they do, after Julie sorrowfully says goodbye to the girl Magnolia. Years later we return to the boat, where Magnolia is now eighteen and the newest leading lady. She has no leading man. After Gaylord Ravenal, a handsome riverboat gambler, is hired, he and Magnolia promptly fall in love and elope. Months later, Magnolia has had a baby daughter, whom she names Kim (because she was born at the moment when the Cotton Blossom was at the convergence on the Mississippi of the states of Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri). Shortly after, Captain Andy falls overboard during a storm and drowns. Rather than live with the stern Parthy, Magnolia and Ravenal leave for Chicago with Kim. In the big city, the couple is alternately rich and poor, depending on Ravenal's gambling winnings (he does not try to find regular work, and cheats on Magnolia with prostitutes). Finally, after about ten years, Parthy announces she is coming to visit; the destitute Ravenal, desperate for money, borrows some from Hetty Chilson, the local whorehouse madam. He returns to Magnolia at their boarding house but is drunk. As he sleeps off his stupor, she returns the money to Hetty, and discovers the madam's secretary is Julie Dozier. Julie is devastated that Magnolia has found her working in the whorehouse. (The fate of Steve goes unmentioned in the novel.) When Magnolia returns to the boarding house, she finds Ravenal gone, leaving nothing but a farewell note. She never sees him again. She goes out to get work and is hired at a local nightclub called Joppers. The story moves forward to 1926, when show boats are becoming scarce on the Mississippi River. Kim has married and become a successful actress on Broadway in New York City. Her father Ravenal has been dead for several years. One night, Magnolia receives a telegram announcing the death of her mother Parthy, from whom she has been long estranged. She returns to the show boat, which she decides to keep and manage, rather than to scrap. She gives all of her inheritance from Parthy, a fortune, to her daughter Kim. Joining Magnolia is Ellie, a widow since her husband Schultzy has died.

The Sport of the Gods," Berry Hamilton, an emancipated black man, works as a butler for a wealthy white man Maurice Oakley. Berry lives in a small cottage a short distance away from the Oakley's place of residence. Berry lives with his wife, Fannie, and two children, Joe and Kitty. During a farewell dinner for Maurice's younger brother, Francis Oakley, it becomes known that a large sum of money has disappeared from Oakley residence. Maurice is soon convinced that Berry stole the money. A court finds Berry guilty of the theft and sentences him to ten years of hard labor. Maurice and his wife expel Fannie, Joe, and Kitty from the cottage. Unable to find work, Fannie and her children decide to move to New York. Once in New York, Joe begins work and starts regularly visiting the Banner Club. He begins dating an entertainer from the club named Hattie Sterling. To Fannie's disapproval, Hattie helps Kitty to find employment as a singer and actress. Joe's situation quickly declines and he becomes an alcoholic. Hattie breaks the relationship. Completely degraded, Joe strangles Hattie. Later, he confesses to the murder and finds himself in prison. With her husband and son in prison, Fannie is distraught. Kitty convinces Fannie to marry a man named Mr. Gibson. Francis Oakley, who left for Paris to become an artist, sends a message to Maurice Oakley. When Maurice receives the letter, he postulates that it could be a message informing him of the artistic successes of Francis. To his dismay, it describes how Francis stole the money and he wishes for Berry Hamilton to be released from prison. Maurice decides that he will not announce Berry's innocence in hopes of preserving the honor of his brother and himself. Mr. Skaggs, an acquaintance of Joe at the Banner Club, overhears the story of Berry Hamilton's conviction for theft. As a writer for New York's Universe, Mr. Skaggs postulates that if he can prove Berry's innocence, he will have a popular article for the publisher. He travels to the hometown of the Hamilton's to converse with Maurice Oakley. He first meets with a man named Colonel Saunders who tells him that he believes Berry is innocent, the money was simply lost, and to protect the secret, Maurice Oakley carries the money in his ""secret"" pocket at all times. To gain entry into the Oakley residence, Skaggs lies about having a letter from Francis. Mr. Skaggs forcibly removes Francis's letter from Maurice's secret pocket. With Francis letter, Mr. Skaggs is able to have Berry pardoned after five years in prison. Mr. Skaggs brings Berry to New York. Soon, Berry finds out about his son, daughter, and wife's new husband. Hopeless, Berry plans to murder his wife's suitor. To Berry's fortune, he finds that Mr. Gibson has been killed in a fight at a racetrack. Broken down by the hardships of the city, Fannie and Berry decide to move back to the cottage near the Oakley residence when the apologetic Mrs. Oakley begs them to return.
","The Sport of the Gods Author: Paul Laurence Dunbar Release Date: February 25, 2006 [EBook #17854] The SPORT OF THE GODS by PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR Author of ""Lyrics of Lowly Life,"" ""Poems Joe and Kitty were both eighteen years old . Their early lives were pleasant and carefully guarded . They got what schooling the town afforded, but both went to work early . Maurice Oakley was not a man of sudden or violent enthusiasms . Conservatism was the quality that had been the foundation of his fortunes at a time when the disruption of the country involved most of the men of his region in ruin . Francis Oakley was a great favourite both with men and women . He had the face and brow of a poet, a pallid face framed in a mass of dark hair . There were brilliant women there who had queened it in Richmond, Baltimore, Louisville, and New Francis and Claire Lessing made a fine picture as they sat together to-night . Some of these thoughts were in the minds of the brother and sister now . ""You 're wronging me, Esterton,"" says Francis . Francis Oakley re-entered the room with his brother . ""If it is no worse than loss, I am glad; but what is it?"" he questioned, hurrying to him . The younger man pulled himself together . ""I don't know what you 'll think of me, Maurice,"" he says . ""Don't stop to accuse yourself. Our only hope in this matter lies in prompt action"" ""You have no right to talk that way, Frank, you know I do not be ""There is no redeeming of yourself to do, my dear boy,"" says Frank . ""I hate to shove everything unpleasant off on you, It 's what I 've been doing all my life,"" Frank says . The old negro knew nothing of the value of money Frank and Maurice went to the telephone and rung up the police station . When he came he insisted that if he was to do anything he must question the robbed man and search his room at once . ""I am sorry to disturb you again, Frank,"" Frank Oakley hurried up the hall with his brother and the detective . ""Come, come, Frank, you must take a drink now and go to bed,"" Oakley said . He threw his own down as he walked towards his room . ""I reckon dat 's what dey come fu'. I was n't payin' so much 'tention' to dey eat as to de way dem women was dressed . ""Well, I got to be goin',"" said Berry, rising to his work ""I shall deal with him as he deserves,"" his brother says . ""Whether I fail or succeed, you will always think well of me, Maurice?"" ""He will always be our Frank, our good, generous-hearted, noble boy. God bless him!"" ""Don't be revenge ""As you will, sir. Will you have him called here and question him, or will you let me question him at once?"" ""I will. Berry, you deposited five hundred dollars at the bank yesterday?"" ""You ain't de beatenes' man to fin Mistah Oakley gave evidences of giving way to grief . ""I think it would be better to call her, but let this matter be done with soon,"" Oakley said . At the word ""arrest,"" his wife collapsed utterly, and sobbed on her husband Berry Hamilton was arrested on the charge preferred by his employer . Maurice Oakley was a solid man of business, and Berry was an honest, sensible negro . There were only a few who dared to say, ""I don't believe it of him"" ""Wy, dat gal o' his'n"" broke in old Isaac Brown indignantly, ""w'y, she would n' speak to my gal, Minty"" the women were loud in their abuse of the Hamiltons and in disparagement of their high- ""I disagree with you entirely, Mr. Talbot,"" broke in Mr. Beachfield Davis, who was a mighty hunter . ""This man took that money with the same innocence of purpose with which one of our servants a few years ago,"" said Davis . Dodson Tell us who has got the money if he has n't . Tell us where on earth the nigger got the cash he 's been putting in the bank? Doubt? Why, there is n’t the least doubt about it . "" ""You may go,"" Fannie Oakley tells her husband . ""You must go,"" he says, ""you can't be a nigger,"" ""you must go"" Berry was convicted of ten years at hard labour . Maurice Oakley was convicted of criminal hardihood . With the conviction of her husband the last five hundred dollars had been confiscated . She had the means at her disposal to tide over their present days of misfortune . Joe and Kit saw her go as if she were Berry Hamilton's son found this out almost as soon as he had applied for work . ""You ain't been practisin' lately, has you?"" came from the back of the shop, where a grinning negro was scraping a fellow' Young Hamilton sat down on a bench where the bellmen were wont to stay during the day . Then he saw the head bellman talking to the clerk and looking in his direction . ""I did n't know that you were Berry Hamilton's boy,"" Joe ""Oh, you 're tired to death,"" says Fannie . ""I 've got some tea made for you, and you just take a cup,"" she says . Joe looked on silently, the maternal instinct for the protection of her daughter . ""You 're mekin' it ha'dah fu' me to baih when you talk dat a-way,"" says Joe . ""I guess he 'd think we was doin' the best we could,"" says his mother . Joe remained su a new emotion will take his heart as the people hasten by him . It is better here, and the city is cruel and cold and unfeeling . After a while he will find a place and give a sigh of relief as he settles away from The Hamiltons reached New York on a clear October day . Joe and Kitty were more concerned with what they saw about them than with what their future would hold . They found Mrs. Jones, the proprietress, both gracious and willing to come to terms with them . Joe and Kit were differently affected by what they saw about them . The boy was wild with enthusiasm and with a desire to be a part of all that the metropolis meant . He was in New York, and now he would learn . The provincial who comes to New York is his pride at his insensibility to certain impressions . By and by, from mere pretending, it becomes real. He grows callous. After that he goes to the devil very cheerfully . There was a sort of comp ""I 'm never strange with anybody,"" says Mr. Thomas . Mrs. Jones slapped her knee and laughed until her bust shook like jelly . ""Mr. Thomas is a case, sho',"" she said; ""but he likes you Mrs. Hamilton sat long into the night with her little family discussing New York's advantages and disadvantages . ""You ought to git Mr. Thomas to take you to the th'atre some night. He goes lots,"" she said . Mrs. Jones' assurance as to Joe and Kit had sat far up in the peanut gallery in the place reserved for people of colour . They had good seats in the first balcony, and by contrast with it, even the garishness of the cheap New York theatre seemed fine and glorious . There was something weird to her in negro marches were accompanied by a rhythmic patting of feet from all parts of the house . They were dressed in costumes that were not intended for picnic going . But they gave almost a semblance of dignity to the tawdry music and in Mr. Thomas was quietly taking stock of his young companion,--of her innocence and charm . ""Oh, no, I 'm not smart enough,"" he whispered to her. ""Maybe you will some day,"" she replied wisely. ""We 'll see,"" ""You 'll see a lot o' the show people,"" he says . ""No, I reckon we 'd bettah go home,"" says Mrs. Hamilton . Joe winced again at ""de chillen"" ""Mebbe Miss Kitty Sadness, a young man, was a patron of the Banner Club . The proprietor asked him why he had never been in the city before . ""I 've got a friend with me to-night. He 's got some dough on him,"" he said ""A distant relative of mine once had a great grief. I have never recovered from it,"" he said . ""I don't know as I ought to,"" said Sadness . Thomas and Joe left the crowd after a while, and went to the upper floor . The Banner Club was an institution for the lower education of negro youth . It drew its pupils from every class of people and from every part of the country . The Banner was a substitute--poor, it must be confessed--to many youths Skaggsy was born and reared on a Vermont farm, where his early life was passed in fighting for his very subsistence . He was a monumental liar, and the saving quality about him was that he calmly believed his own lies while he was Joe's sponsor explained to him that he was not to take in what Skaggsy said . He ended with, ""Everybody knows Maudie, and that coloured girl is Mamie Lacey"" The master of ceremonies opened proceedings by saying that ""The free concert would now X A VISITOR FROM HOME Mrs. Hamilton began to question very seriously whether she had done the best thing in coming to New York as she saw her son staying away more and more and growing always farther away from her and his sister . She knew that although he worked he never had She complained that Joe was away from them so much enjoying himself . But as that gentleman never included the mother in his invitation, she decided that her daughter should go no more, and she begged Joe to take his sister out sometimes instead . The quick poison of the unreal life about her had already ""You must 'a' been lettin' the cats lick yo' upper lip,"" he said . ""Well, I ain't right-down glad to see you! How are you?"" ""I 'm middlin', Mint ""Oh, that 's all right,"" Minty Brown says . ""You know I ain't the kin' o' person that holds a grudge ag'in anybody,"" he tells her . Mrs. Hamilton refuses to give  ""I ain't goin' to cuss hyeah befo' me, an' I won't stan' it,"" Mrs. Jones says . ""I reckon all dat kin be 'splained,"" Fannie says  XI BROKEN HOPES What Joe Hamilton lacked more than anything else in the world was some one to kick him . It is corrective and clarifying, for though he knew himself a cur, he went away from his mother's house feeling himself aggr Young Hamilton hastened to protest . ""Oh, I know you fellows now well enough to know how many drinks to pay for,"" he said . It's a pity most men are n't. They would lose so many good things learning, he says Sadness has been indicted twice for pocket-picking . he is a ragpicker who is just coming in with about two thousand dollars . It's a fine, rich life, my lad, and a man never gets lonesome . Sadness invited Joe, and Joe felt honoured . It was plain to him that to want a good reputation was the sign of unpardonable immaturity, and that dishonour was the only real thing worth while . He thought about the whole matter in the old, ignorant ""I hope you ain't lettin' that long-tongued Brown woman bother your head, are you?"" Her heart seemed to stand still . ""You might know she 'd come to me first with her story,"" ""you go on and leave me?"" "" Sadness turned his mournful eyes upon Minty . ""You 've told me once or twice that your sister could sing. Bring her down here to me, and if she can do anything, I 'll help me do her,"" Sadness said . XII ""ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE"" Kitty fell desperately in love with Hattie Sterling the first time they met . She called her ""child"" in a pretty, patronising way, and patted her on the cheek . Already Joe took on  ""You 've got a good chance, and maybe you 'll have more sense than I have got,"" says Kitty . ""I ain't goin' just yet,"" says Hattie Sterling, who is a ""hot one"" ""I don't want nothin' but to pull you down an' den laugh at you w'en you 's dragged in de dust,"" Kit hung her head . ""You must n't feel that away, ma. I 'm doin' ""Martin's Blackbirds"" was advertised to be bigger and better than ever before . He came in hurried, fierce, and important, from his head to his feet . ""I might as well go de way both my chillen 's gone. Po' Be'y ""You walk like a lot of tin soldiers. Are your joints rusty? Do you want oil? Look here, Taylor, if I did n't know you, I 'd take you for a truck!"" and he would drop his head in despair  Kitty Hamilton had never sung before at anything more formidable than a church concert . When she was done, she was startled to hear Martin burst into a raucous laugh . She choked back her fright and forced the music from her lips . Maurice Oakley and Claire Lessing wished that brother Frank's five years were past . They had letters from him now and then, never very cheerful in tone, but always breathing the deepest love and gratitude to them . ""Brother ought to know,"" Maurice said, Maurice Oakley brought him a letter more bulky in weight and appearance than any he had yet received . It was such a large, interesting-looking package, but it simply reeked of possibilities . Let him begin, anyway, away down, for instance, let the ""My fancies go on and conquer the world for my brother,"" he muttered . The letter drew his eyes back to it, and it seemed to invite him to beg him even . When Frank and Claire marry, I shall give it back to them . Leslie was careless and unfeeling. She ought to come; he was tired of waiting . A carriage rolled up the driveway and he dropped the letter guiltily . He would take it out and show her that he had exercised self-control in spite of her shortcomings ""I know you will grieve at receiving this, and I wish that I might bear your grief for you,"" he wrote . ""I am not blaming you, but I know that my hypocrisy made you believe me possessed of a really soft heart"" ""You ""My brother, FRANK,"" he cried . ""I wanted the secret for my own. I wanted to carry it to my grave with me"" Maurice Oakley feared too for his heart, and so did not argue with him . When the doctor came, he found XIV FRANKENSTEIN Five years is but a short time in the life of a man, and many things may happen therein, he says . he is not true of the first sixteen or seventeen years, but the habits of years are hard to change . ""You 're the thing I 've given up all my chances for--you, a miserable, drunken jay, without a jay's decency,"" she said . ""You're not the only star in sight, see?"" she laughed meanly Sadness and Skaggsy were together at Banner club that night . ""I tell you, Sadness,"" he said impulsively, ""dancing is the dialect poetry"" ""I 'm goin' to kill her,"" Sadness said . ""I confess I am disappointed, but I 've got an idea, just the same,"" Sadness rose . ""You see drunken men tell the truth, and you don't seem to get much guilt out of our young friend,"" he sneered Sadness . XV ""DEAR, DAMNED, DELIGHTFUL TOWN"" He was taken by the very indifference with which he met everything concerned with his crime . From the very first he made no effort to exonerate or vindicate himself . Sadness and all the club, with a muttered ""Poor devil!"" dismissed him . They wanted to preach to these people that good agriculture is better than bad art . But even what they suffered from these was better than what awaited them in the great alleys Miss Kitty Hamilton felt the shame of it keenly, and some of the grief . Joe had been prone to ""touch"" his sister for the wherewithal to supply his various wants . When she grew tired and refused to be ""touched,"" he rebuked ""I see the thing as clear as day. There 's no getting around it,"" Skaggs said . The editor seemed hard to convince him that he had a working theory . ""You 're taking a chance. You're losing time. If it fails Colonel Saunders: ""I am one of the few men who have come to believe that the negro, Berry Hamilton, is not the guilty party"" ""I don't think it could possibly interest you, who are familiar with the records of the really great crimes that take place in  Maurice Oakley had been as sound as a dollar, and no one of the family had had any tendency to heart affection . ""Strange it is, but I have my theory,"" he says, ""but, as I have said, I believe you"" ""If I were a Maurice Oakley sat down to think out what he should do to-morrow . ""You cannot see him. Mr. Oakley is not well and does not see visitors,"" Skaggs replied . The man was as a man who trembled on ""Your brother bade me to say to you that you have a terrible secret, that you bear it in your breast--there. I am his messenger. He bids you to give it to me."" The reporter moved nearer him . The old man shrunk against the wall, The _Universe_ had always claimed to be the friend of all poor and oppressed humanity . In this way it managed to do a considerable amount of good, and its yellowness became forgivable, even commendable . The story was vivid, interesting, dramatic Colonel Saunders was inanely eloquent for an hour over his pet theory . He was to beard the Governor in his den, and he was to demand for the people the release of an innocent man . In an hour after receiving his telegram he ""This is a very happy occasion, Mr. Hamilton,"" says Berry Hamilton . ""I ain't hyeahed f'om my people fu' a long time. I did n't know what had become of 'em."" ""Don't you know me?"" he asked brokenly . ""Why, is you 'shamed o' me?"" she sank into a chair and began rocking to and fro in her helpless grief . He had to be photographed before he could ""Don't cry, Be'y, don't, you hu't me. I could n't he'p it,"" Berry said . ""You ain't my wife no mo'? Hit 's a lie, a damn Fannie Gibson was killed in a fight at the race-track . He was blinded by his emotions and set his face towards the lodging he had taken temporarily .

Forever," Katherine, in the middle of her senior year in high school, finds herself strongly attracted to Michael, a boy she meets at a New Year's party. As their relationship unfolds, the issue of sex comes up more as an emotional and health issue than as a moral one. Both of them are aware that physical intimacy is both common and complicated. Michael has been sexually active, while Katherine hasn't. Their relationship progresses slowly as they begin to go on dates and trips together; they are accompanied on various meetings by Katherine's friend, Erica, who has known Katherine since the 9th grade and believes that sex is a physical act and not a romantic act. Erica and Katherine are also joined by Michael's friend Artie, who, with Erica's help, explores and acknowledges some uncertainty about his own sexuality. Artie is a depressed teenager who feels life is over after high school. He shows his depression when he attempts to hang himself from his shower curtain rod but fails. When Katherine and Michael do have sex on Michael's sister's bedroom floor, they are sure it seals a love that will be ""forever."" Michael buys Katherine a necklace for her birthday that says both of their names on it and it also says ""Forever"". However, separated for the summer by work that takes them to two different states, Katherine finds herself aware of the limitations of the relationship and ultimately attracted to a tennis instructor, Theo, who is older and more experienced in life. She takes responsibility for breaking the news to Michael when he comes on a surprise visit and almost catches her and Theo together. Katherine realizes the 'loss' of Michael, while painful at first, can be the start of new successful relationships. The book ends with Katherine's mother giving her a message that Theo called for her.
","Charles Dennison stumbled across an intriguing clue which led him into a different branch of biology . After three more years, a lucky accident put the final proofs into his hands . He had invented a most effective longevity drug . It was not proof against violence, however, it could fairly be called an immortality serum . Man willed to know all nature's secrets, and there was no way of keeping them hidden . On the subway, Dennison was absorbed in a newspaper . He was barely conscious of the men sitting on either side of him . Then he realized that they were probably just after his money . Dennison saw no policeman along the crowded Bronx street . People stood aside as he ran past, staring open-mouthed . But his voice lacked the moral indignation, the absolute conviction of his two shrill-voiced pursuers . Dennison yanked out the stopper and drained the contents . He ducked into a narrow alley between buildings, raced down it and into the next street . There were two cars on that street, at either end of the block, their headlights shining toward each other . ""The world is not ready for it yet,"" says Mr. Bennet . ""You're trying to impress me,"" Dennison says . He says the immortality serum provides a solution to the problem of political power . ""You have taken your own serum, have you not?"" Dennison nodded . ""You are a reasonable man, and I think you'll come to see things our way,"" Dennison said . The rest of us have formed the Immortality Club . In one hundred and thirty-seven years, Dennison and his colleagues revealed the Undertakers' Plot .

The Magic of Oz," At the top of Mount Munch, lives a group of people known as the Hyups. One of their numbers, a Munchkin named Bini Aru, discovered a method of transforming people and objects by merely saying the word ""Pyrzqxgl"". After Princess Ozma decreed that no one could practice magic in Oz except for Glinda the Good Witch and the Wizard of Oz, Bini wrote down the directions for pronouncing ""Pyrzqxgl"" and hid them in his magical laboratory. When Bini and his wife are at a fair one day, their son Kiki Aru, who thirsts for adventure, finds the directions and afterwards transforms himself into a hawk and visits various countries outside the land of Oz. When he alights in the land of Ev, Kiki Aru learns that he needs money to pay for a night's lodging (versus Oz, where money is not used at all) and changes himself into a magpie to steal a gold piece from an old man. A sparrow confronts the then-human Kiki Aru with knowledge of the theft, and Kiki says that he did not know what it was like to be wicked before, he is glad that he is now. This conversation is overheard by Ruggedo, the Nome who was exiled to the Earth's surface in Tik-Tok of Oz, and he sees through Kiki Aru's power a chance to get revenge on the people of Oz. Kiki changes himself and Ruggedo into birds and they fly over the Deadly Desert into the Land of Oz. They enter Oz as animals to escape detection by Glinda and to recruit an army of conquest from the country's wild animal population. When they first appear in the Forest of Gugu in the Gillikin Country, Kiki changes himself and Ruggedo into Li-Mon-Eags (fictional creatures with the heads of lions, the bodies of monkeys, and the wings of eagles as well as having the tails of donkeys) and lies that they've seen the people of the Emerald City plan to enslave the animal inhabitants of the Forest. Ruggedo claims that they the Li-Mon-Eags will transform the animals into humans and march on the Emerald City and transform its inhabitants into animals, driving them into the forest. Ruggedo proves their power (for Kiki's the only one who knows ""Pyrzqxgl"") by having Kiki transform one of the leopard king Gugu's advisors, Loo the unicorn, into a man and back again. Gugu offers to meet with the leaders of the other animal tribes to decide on this matter of invasion. Dorothy and the Wizard arrive with the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger in the Forest of Gugu during this council of war with a request for monkeys to train in time for Ozma's upcoming birthday party. Ruggedo recognizes his old enemies and inspires Kiki to begin transforming people and animals left and right &mdash; including Ruggedo, whom Kiki turns against by transforming him into a goose, a transformation that the Nomes most fears because as a goose he might lay an egg. The Wizard, whom Kiki transformed into a fox, follows the Li-Mon-Eag with his magic bag, the transformed Kiki, deep into the forest where he begins transforming monkeys into giant human soldiers. However, Kiki makes them so big that they cannot move through the trees. The Wizard, however, heard how to correctly pronounce ""Pyrzqxgl"" and first stops Kiki and Ruggedo by transforming them into a walnut and a hickory nut. Then the Wizard resumes his rightful form and changes Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, and Gugu back to their forms, and he agrees to change the soldiers back into monkeys. The Wizard recruits several of the grateful monkeys and shrinks them down to bring back to the Emerald City and train. On arriving there, Dorothy and the Wizard are dispatched to a magic island where Cap'n Bill and Trot went to get a magic flower for Ozma's birthday. However, the island itself causes anything living that touches it to take root there, and that is how the sailor and his friend are found when Dorothy and the Wizard arrive. The Wizard uses ""Pyrzqxgl"" to change Cap'n Bill and Trot into honeybees which narrowly avoid being eaten by the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger. When they are human again, Cap'n Bill retrieves the flower by strapping a wood plank onto his good leg, walks with that and his wooden leg onto the island, and retrieves the flower. Back at the Emerald City, Ozma and her friends celebrate her birthday (though without quite the pomp and fanfare from The Road to Oz) and then decide how to deal with the evil magicians transformed into nuts. The Wizard uses ""Pyrzqxgl"" to change them back to Kiki Aru and Ruggedo and make them thirsty enough to drink the Water of Oblivion, which will make them forget all that they have ever known. The now-blank slate Kiki Aru and Ruggedo will live in the Emerald City and learn to be good and kind.
","The Famous Oz Books Since 1900, when L. Frank Baum introduced THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ and all the other exciting characters who inhabit the land of Oz, these delightful fairy tales have stimulated the imagination of millions of young readers . Each of the 40 volumes which now comprise “The Magic of Oz” is really more strange and unusual than anything I have read or heard about on our side of The Great Sandy Desert which shut us off from The Land of Oz . From now on I hope to be able to give prompt attention to each and every letter with which my readers favor me Bini Aru had discovered a new and secret method of transformations that was unknown to any other Sorcerer . By its means, it was the simplest thing in the world to transform anyone into beast, bird or fish, and back again, once you knew how to pronounce the mystical Bini Aru stubbed his toe on one of the floor boards to see if he could find any of his magic tools . As he went in, Kiki decided to enter his father’s private room, where he was forbidden to go . But he decided Kiki Aru was about to replace the board when it slipped from his hand and turned over . He found that the writing described exactly how to pronounce Pyrzqxgl . Then he folded the paper and put it in his pocket, and replaced it in the floor . Kiki Aru flew north and settled on a tree-top in the Kingdom of Noland . He was tired by this time, and the sun was now setting, so he decided to stay here till morning . After a day in Queen Zixi’s palace and gardens In the Land of Ev he resumed his own shape again, for the cities and villages were close together and he could easily go on foot from one to another of them . Kiki Aru flew to a group of trees and, dropping the gold piece to the ground, resumed Two Bad Ones CHAPTER 3 Kiki turned around and saw a queer old man standing near . He wore dull-gray clothes that were tight fitting, and his pockets were bunched out as if stuffed full of something . The Nome King gave him a  “I’ll give you _two_ pocketsful of jewels,” said the Nome . “No, no, no!” said Kiki, who realized that to share his power with another would be dangerous to himself . “I’ll help do that,” said Kiki, “but I won’t tell you my secret.” The Nome was so furious at this refusal that he jumped up and down with rage and spluttered and choked for a long time before he could control Glinda the Good has a Great Book called the Book of Records . It is magically written everything that people do in the Land of Oz, just the instant they do it . The book doesn’t make a record of what birds do, or beasts. It only tells the “It is impossible to kill anyone in the Land of Oz,” said Kiki . “I’m afraid I don’t understand you,” objected the boy. “Will the beasts consent, do you think?” asked the boy . A Happy Corner of Oz CHAPTER 5 There is no other country so beautiful as the Land of Oz . There are no other people so happy and contented and prosperous as the Oz people . They love and admire their beautiful girl Ruler, Ozma of Oz, and they mix work and Ozma’s Royal Palace is the most splendid building ever constructed . From a hundred towers and domes floated the banners of Oz, which included the Ozmies, the Munchkins, the Gillikins, and the Quadlings . Ozmas own banner has  Ozma _needs_ anything, but that it will please her to know we’ve remembered her birthday . “I’ve tried to think and I can’t,” Trot said . The Glass Cat is one of the most curious creatures in all Oz . It was made “Here, wake up,” said Cap’n Bill. “How dare you disturb me?” it asked in a peevish voice . “Do you think I’m a fool? Look at my brains—you can see ’em work. Of course I remember Ozma’s Birthday Presents CHAPTER 6 When Cap’n Bill and Trot started for the hidden island in the far-off river to get the Magic Flower, Dorothy wondered again . “I’ve written a song for her,” answered the strange Patchwork Girl, who went by Ozma has always admired my straw filling, so I’m sure she’ll be pleased with any her loving friends give her . ""You’ll have to _think_, Dorothy; that’s the only way to get a good idea,"" said the girl . The The Sawhorse was a swift and willing traveler, and although it could talk if need arose, it seldom said anything unless spoken to . The Sorceress was tall and stately, dressed in a splendid and becoming gown, “what are you going to “I want you to help me fix up a present for Ozma,” says Dorothy . “I’m going to make a great cake, with frosting and candles, and all that, you know.” “Very good,” repeated the Wizard . The Wizard looked at Ozma with admiring approval, and chuckled again . “Do you think they’ll object?” asked the girl . ""Then, it’s a bargain,"" said the Wizard . Gugu Forest is the home of most of the wild beasts that inhabit Oz . The biggest beasts inhabit the great forest, while the smaller ones live mostly in the mountain underbrush at the east . Now, you must know that there are laws in the forests, as well as in every other place All kinds of beasts live here, and a yellow leopard is King . If we become leopards, the King will be jealous of us . “I wonder if the beasts will attack us?” asked Kiki . Gugu the Leopard King called his royal Counselors together to decide how best to punish the offenders . The four lords of the forest were holding solemn council in a small clearing . They saw two strange beasts approaching them—beasts the like of which they had “I wouldn’t lie for the world; I—” “Silence!” again growled Gugu the King . “Why, I can fly, you know, having the wings of an Eagle,” explained Ruggedo . “Prove what?” asked Ruggedo. “If you fail, we will destroy you.” “All right,” said the Nome. “But I’m tired, so I’ll let my comrade make the transformation.” “It’s true!” shouted the man-b ""You’d better make me a Unicorn again,"" says Ruggedo the Nome . ""To-morrow,"" he said to Kiki Aru, ""we’ll win over these beasts and set them to fight and conquer the Oz people."" ""But I am doing all Trot was disturbed by sounds from the forest, but she was confident Cap’n Bill would protect her from harm . At daybreak they reached the bank of a river, but as they followed the banks in a northerly direction it gradually broadened . After the travelers had passed around the Cap’n Bill was cutting from trees some long stakes, making them sharp at one end and leaving a crotch at the other end . Trot jumped up, greatly frightened, and looked at the terrible animal as if they were frantic with rage  Cap’n Bill knew he could not kill the Kalidah, for no living thing in Oz can be killed . So he stood back and watched the beast wriggle and growl and paw the earth with its sharp claws . “Are you sure he can “I don’t care,” the beast replied in a surly tone . “You ought to admire my pink brains, anyhow,” said the Glass Cat . Cap’n Bill had now cut all his logs to a proper size . Cap’n Bill squatted down and examined Trot’s feet and decided that the Glass Cat was right . “This is hard luck,” he declared, in a voice that showed he was uneasy at the discovery . The Kalidah was facing the island, Trot and Cap’n Bill were the most disagreeable creatures in the Land of Oz . Now the Kalidahs were nonetheless magical inhabitants of a magical Fairyland . “We’re livin’ in a magic country, but neither of us knows any magic an’ so The Beasts of the Forest of Gugu CHAPTER 11 That was a wonderful gathering of wild animals . Rango the Gray Ape had even called his monkey sentinels away from the forest edge . Back of the beasts were the pumas, jaguars, tigers Ruggedo the Nome sprang upon the flat rock beside Gugu the King . His lion’s face was surrounded by a mane of pure white hair; his eagle’s wings were attached to the shoulders of his monkey body and were so long they nearly Ruggedo the Nome said: ‘We will save our friends and have revenge on the Oz people’ . “The Oz people are fairies, and you can’t fight against magic unless you also have magic,” replied Ruggeda . The Oz people, having become beasts, will Kiki uses His Magic CHAPTER 12 Then arose a great confusion of sounds as all the animals began talking to their fellows . Ruggedo the Nome waved his arms and fluttered his wings to try to make them listen to him again, but the beasts paid “We have known you many years ago, before you went to live at the Emerald City, so we know you are the King of all Beasts.” “I did not come here to rule the beasts of this forest. Gugu is King here, and I believe he is a good King and All these things passed through the mind of the Hyup boy while the Cowardly Lion and Gugu the King were talking together, and that was why he began to do several strange things . The Wizard, who stood smilingly beside his friends, suddenly felt his form change to that of a  Kiki Aru transformed Gugu into a fat Gillikin woman, and laughed aloud to see how the woman pranced with rage . They were so astonished and bewildered by their new shapes that they could only look at one another in a dazed ""Let’s look and see if we can find it,"" suggested Dorothy the Lamb . The Goose searched as earnestly as the others, for if he could find it . Ruggedo was not really sorry, now that he thought about it, that Kiki had transformed “Why did you come here, anyway?” asked the Cowardly Lion . “We wanted to borrow a dozen monkeys, to use on Ozma’s birthday,” explained the Forest King . ""I’m afraid it’s too late, now,” said Dorothy . The Glass Cat walked slowly, and its pink brains rolled and tumbled around at a great rate . When the Glass Cat reached the clearing, it saw a Fox, a Lamb, Rabbit, Munchkin boy and a fat Gillikin woman wandering around in an “I’m Gugu, King of the Forest,” said the Fat Woman . The Glass Cat laughed again . “That Magician must look funnier than you do,” it said . The Wizard learns the Magic Word CHAPTER 14 Now, the Goose was the transformation of old Ruggedo the Nome, who was at one time King of the Nomes . The Nome detested anything in the way of a bird, because birds lay eggs and eggs are feared by Old Ruggedo muttered to himself: “This boy is the goose, although it is I who wear the goose’s shape.” Then he said aloud to Kiki: “Well, hereafter I will be content to acknowledge you the master. You bungled things, as The Wizard Fox decided it would be safer for him to hide inside the hollow tree . ""This is my plan,"" said the Nome to Kiki, speaking so low that the Wizard could only hear the rumble of his voice . “We need a great army, but not a numerous Kiki Aru the Hyup disappeared and a small hickory-nut rolled upon the ground . But the Wizard Fox had heard quite plainly every word that he had said . Ruggedo now began pronouncing the Magic Word in every way he could think of Dorothy the Lamb uttered a bleat of delight when she saw her old friend restored to his natural shape . The Wizard showed his astonished friends the hickory-nut and the walnut to prove that he had spoken the truth . Trot and Cap’ Trot plucked a peach from the bush and began to eat it, finding it delicious . “Grab one, Cap’n!” exclaimed Trot, and even while eating the peach she seized a banana with her other hand . The old sailor was “I’m not a fairy or a wizard or any kind of a magic-maker.” “Do you think I could wish for anything else, Cap’n, and get it?” she asked anxiously . “Try it yourself, Trot. I’m gett’n “You’ll keep growing smaller every day, until bye and bye there’ll be nothing left of you,” said Cap’n Bill . “I’ve lived a long time, and I’ve got to live forever, because I belong in the Land of Oz, where no living The Lonesome Duck began waddling about in a small circle . It went around the circle to the right three times, then it hopped backward three times and forward three times . Trot kept quiet, after the rebuke, and the Duck resumed the quacky  Rango the Gray Ape, Chief of all the monkey tribes of the forest, heard the uproar and came to see what was wrong with his people . Rango realized that the six giant soldiers were helpless prisoners, because of their size, and knew he was powerless to release them  The Glass Cat had been greatly interested in the Gray Ape’s story and was curious to see what the giant soldiers looked like . After seeing the giants’ heads extended above the tree-tops, the Glass Cat decided that if it climbed the tall avocado tree, it might be able “Don’t you admire my pink brains?” asked the Glass Cat . “Well, I’ll admit they’re better _hunters_,” said the Wizard, reluctantly, “but you can’t do it.” “That shows how much you know!” retorted The Gray Ape announced that the Wizard wanted to borrow twelve monkeys to take to the Emerald City for a couple of weeks, and asked for volunteers, nearly a hundred offered to go . The Wizard chose a dozen that seemed intelligent and good-tempered, and then he took out a The Wizard of Oz and Princess Dorothy enter the Forest of Gugu hereafter . They will be as welcome and safe with us as ever they are in the Emerald City . ""I know all the Land of Oz better than any other living creature knows it,"" said the Glass Cat . The Glass Cat drew out a small axe, made of some metal so highly polished it glittered brightly even in the dark forest . The Wizard picked up the magic axe and after carefully wiping it with his silk handkerchief put it away in his black bag . ""I know ’em, and they’re stuck fast, all right. You may as well go back home, for no power can save them,"" said Dorothy . ""I’m the great Forest Magician, as any beast can tell you, but even I have no power to destroy Trot and Cap’n Bill arrived at a place just opposite the Magic Isle . The Glass Cat walked across the river under the water to tell Trot not to worry . Trot mumbled some magic words and poured over them a yellow liquid from a crystal vial Trot and Cap’n Bill tried to move their feet and failed . “Oh!” said the Wizard, “I guess that will set her free.” Trot’s feet were still rooted in the ground of the Magic Isle . The Glass Cat now came back to their side of the river, The Wizard paddled the clumsy raft across the water and ran it upon the beach of the Magic Isle as close to the place where Cap’n Bill and Trot were rooted . “If you can’t save us soon, there’ll be nothing left of us,” counsel Trot and Cap’n Bill flew two bumble-bees across the river to where the Lion and the Tiger waited . The Wizard picked up the paddle and paddled the raft across as fast as he could . “You are not the only two bees in Trot and Cap’n Bill stood beside them as natural as before they had met their fearful adventure . The Wizard had transformed them from bumble-bees into shapes and sizes that nature had given them . Trot was softly crying because she was so happy, the Wizard s Cap’n Bill picked it up and on the way to the raft it grew tulips and gladioli . “I guess the Magician who put it on the island never thought that any one would carry it off,” said Dorothy . ""I think _I_ ought to Trot and Dorothy could ride on the back of the Hungry Tiger, and between them they carried the cage of monkeys . The Glass Cat grumbled because it would take so long to get to the Emerald City . By means of his magic the Wizard created three tents, pitched in  The Hungry Tiger cried: “Stop that racket!” and struck at the Glass Cat . The Tiger lay down again to sleep, but the monkeys soon discovered that the bending of the bars would allow them to squeeze through . They did not leave the cage, however, but Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T.E., was appealing to her to punish some of the students of the Royal Athletic College, of which he was the Principal . The College of Athletic Arts CHAPTER 21 Dorothy and her friends arrived at the Royal Palace at an op Professor Wogglebug carelessly invented a Square-Meal Tablet, which was no bigger than your little finger-nail . It contained, in condensed form, the equal of a bowl of soup, a portion of fried fish and a roast . The Ozma, the beautiful girl Ruler of the Fairyland of Oz, was a real fairy . She was so sweet and gentle in caring for her people that she was greatly beloved by them all . They kept the secret, even refusing to tell the Wooden Sawhorse and Ozma was the Royal Ruler of the fairyland of Oz, and by birth belonged to a powerful race . There was also the Fountain of the Water of Oblivion, but it was dangerous to drink of this water, because it made one forget everything he had ever known  Ozma was a queerly assorted company, indeed, for there are more quaint and unusual characters in Oz than in all the rest of the world . On this especial birthday of the lovely girl Ruler, a long table was set in the royal Banquet Hall of the Ozma and Dorothy were quite fond of the Tin Soldier . On Glinda’s left was the jolly Patchwork Girl, who was afraid of the Sorceress . Jack Pumpkinhead had grown a splendid pumpkin for a new head . Ozma was delighted with the success of her “Surprise Cake” . After the dance the monkeys marched up and down the table playing a jolly tune . The Magic Flower attracted her attention first, and Trot had to tell her the whole story of their adventures “I think, Wizard, you ought to transform them into their natural shapes again,” said Ozma . “I’m no wizard, and no fairy, but if you do as I say, we needn’t fear these people at all.” “That’s not a bad idea Ozma, the Wizard and Dorothy crouched beside the fountain and waited . The Wizard placed the hickory-nut on the edge of the fountain . Kiki Aru was now no longer thirsty, but he felt more bewildered than ever .

The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle," A little girl named Lucie lives on a farm called Little-town. She is a good little girl, but has lost three pocket handkerchiefs and a pinafore. She questions Tabby Kitten and Sally Henny-penny about them, but they know nothing. Lucie mounts a stile and spies some white cloths lying in the grass high on a hill behind the farm. She scrambles up the hill along a steep path-way which ends under a big rock. She finds a little door in the hillside, and hears someone singing behind it: :Lily-white and clean, oh! :With little frills between, oh! :Smooth and hot – red rusty spot :Never here be seen, oh! She knocks. A frightened voice cries out, ""Who's that?"" Lucie opens the door, and discovers a low-ceilinged kitchen. Everything is tiny, even the pots and pans. At the table stands a short, stout person wearing a tucked-up print gown, an apron, and a striped petticoat. She is ironing. Her little black nose goes sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes go twinkle, twinkle, and beneath her little white cap are prickles! She is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, the animals' laundress and ""an excellent clear-starcher"". She keeps busy with her work. She has found Lucy's lost things, and launders them for her. She also shows Lucie items belonging to Mrs. Tiggywinkle's animal customers. The laundered clothing is tied up in bundles and Lucie's handkerchiefs are neatly folded into her clean pinafore. They set off together down the path to return the fresh laundry to the little animals and birds in the neighbourhood. At the bottom of the hill, Lucie mounts the stile and turns to thank Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ""But what a very odd thing!"" Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is ""running running running up the hill"". Her cap, shawl, and print gown are nowhere to be seen. How small and brown she has grown – and covered with prickles! ""Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle [is] nothing but a HEDGEHOG!"" The narrator tells the reader that some thought Lucie had fallen asleep on the stile and dreamed the encounter, but if so, then how could she have three clean handkerchiefs and a laundered pinafore? ""Besides,"" the narrator assures the reader, ""I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Catbells – and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!""

The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel," The story starts in Paris in April 1794, year II of the French Revolution. Theresia Cabarrus is a beautiful but shallow Spaniard who is betrothed to Citizen Tallien the popular Representative in the Convention and one of Robespierre's inner circle. She is credited with exercising a mellowing influence over Tallien, whom she met in Bordeaux but although she is engaged to be married to him, what little love she has appears to be lavished on another. Bertrand Moncrif is a good-looking but impulsive young man who appears determined to martyr himself in opposition to the revolutionary government. To this end, he has gathered the siblings of his long-term sweetheart, Régine de Serval, into his plan to denounce Robespierre at one of the Fraternal suppers. Despite warnings from Régine he insists on carrying through his plans which inevitably go awry and the wrath of the mob is soon turned towards the small group. After a timely intervention on the part of the Scarlet Pimpernel, using the guise of the coal heaver Rateau (who also appears in several short stories in The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel - The Cabaret de la Liberté, Needs Must and A Battle of Wits), the de Servals are saved from a lynching while Moncrif lies unconscious and unseen under a table. When he eventually awakens, Bertrand heads straight for Theresia's house (whom he worships) and all thoughts of his old love Régine disappear in her wake. Theresia is horrified to find him at her house as Tallien, Robespierre and several other high-ranking political figures are due at her apartment for a meeting. Realising that he is putting her at risk, Bertrand hides in the kitchen while the men meet. Also present is Citizen Chauvelin, who plans to use Theresia to entrap his old enemy the Scarlet Pimpernel and has been planting ideas to the effect in Robespierre's mind. Robespierre makes it clear that he knows Bertrand was behind the fracas at the supper and implies that Theresia and Bertrand are involved. Despite the implied threat, she refuses to help trap the Pimpernel, but after the party has left she discovers that Bertrand has been taken by the daring Englishman from her kitchen. Chauvelin returns brandishing a note left by the Pimpernel, to persuade her to take part in his plan once more. Peeved at the Pimpernel removing her plaything, she eventually agrees. In England, Moncrif and the de Servals are finally free to resume an almost normal life. Theresia arrives at Dover dressed in men's clothes and claiming she has been driven out of France by her association with Bertrand, in fear of her life. An obviously staged row between the Spaniard and Chauvelin outside Sir Percy's cottage fails to persuade our hero that she is up to anything but mischief, but he seems to relish the prospect of such an intelligent and wily adversary and promises not to reveal her true identity to anyone for he ""is a lover of sport."" With her plans to seduce Percy scuppered, Theresia turns her attention to Sir Percy's wife Marguerite and uses an all too willing Bertrand to set the trap. Lady Blakeney is kidnapped yet again and taken to France and imprisoned as bait for Sir Percy. Can our dashing hero evade capture and live to enjoy a day ""when tyranny was crushed and men dared to be men again""? de:The Scarlet Pimpernel fr:Le Mouron rouge

The Cricket on the Hearth," John Peerybingle, a carrier, lives with his young wife Dot, their baby boy and their nanny Tilly Slowboy. A cricket constantly chirps on the hearth and acts as a guardian angel to the family. One day a mysterious elderly stranger comes to visit and takes up lodging at Peerybingle's house for a few days. The life of the Peerybingles intersects with that of Caleb Plummer, a poor toymaker employed by the miser Mr. Tackleton. Caleb has a blind daughter Bertha, and a son Edward, who traveled to South America and was thought dead. The miser Tackleton is now on the eve of marrying Edward's sweetheart, May, but she does not love Tackleton. Tackleton reveals to John Peerybingle that his wife Dot has allegedly cheated on him and shows him a clandestine scene where Dot embraces the mysterious lodger who is in disguise, a man much younger than he actually seems. John is cut to the heart over this as he loves his wife dearly, but decides after some deliberations to relieve his wife of their marriage contract. In the end, the mysterious lodger is revealed to be none other than Edward who has returned home in disguise. Dot shows that she indeed has been faithful to John. Edward marries May hours before she is scheduled to marry Tackleton. However Tackleton's heart is melted by the Christmas season, like Ebenezer Scrooge, and he surrenders May to her true love.
","The Cricket on the Hearth by Charles Dickens illustrator: George Alfred Williams Release Date: March 10, 2007 [EBook #20795] The book was put forth in a very attractive manner, with illustrations by John Leech, who was the first artist to make these characters live . There followed upon this four others: ""Christmas Carol,"" ""The Battle of Life,"" and Dickens exaggerated many of his comic and satirical characters, as was his right, for caricature . But there remains a host of characters marked by humour and pathos . The interpretations in this volume aim to eliminate the grosser phases of the caricatures in favour of the more human . Mrs. Peerybingle filled the kettle at the water-butt . In doing which she lost her temper, or mislaid it for an instant . The kettle was aggravating and obstinate; it wouldn't allow itself to be adjusted on top bar . the kettle began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat, and to indulge in short vocal snorts, which it checked in the bud . It was that after two or three such vain attempts to stifle its convivial sentiments, it threw off all moroseness, all reserve, and burst into Chirp, Chirrup, chirp! Cricket round the corner, like a great top . The kettle and the Cricket, at one and the same moment, sent each, his fireside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the window . the kettle had had the last of its solo performance; it persevere Mrs. Peerybingle was drawn gently to the fire by a sturdy figure of a man . ""Oh goodness, John!"" said Mrs. P. ""What a state you're in with the weather!"" ""I wish you wouldn't call me Dot, John. I don't know as ever I was nearer,"" said John . ""You don't deserve to be a father,"" says Dot, with all the dignity of an experienced matron . ""You wouldn't so much as know their names, you stupid fellow,"" says John the Carrier . It's very true, John, but how should you know what little complaints children are troubled with, John . ""What a dear old darling of a dunce you are, John, to be sure!"" said Dot . Miss Slowboy had a rare and surprising talent for getting this baby into difficulties . She had several times imperilled its short life in a quiet way peculiarly her own . Tilly Slowboy's astonishment at finding herself so kindly treated, installed in such a comfortable home . ""To have a Cricket on the Hearth is the luckiest thing in all the world!"" said John in his slow way . The Carrier: ""I love the Cricket for its sake!"" ""Why, John! My Goodness, John!"" cried Dot . ""Leave a woman alone to find out that,"" said John admiringly . Mrs. Peerybingle nodded, fifty times at least . ""Why, she and I were girls at school together, John?"" replied Dot . ""How many more cups of tea shall I drink to-night, at one sitting, than Gruff and Tackleton ever took in four, I wonder?"" he awoke no smile in the face of his little wife, who stood among the parcels . ""You're such an undeniably good sleeper, sir,"" says the Stranger . ""I have half a mind to ask you where the other six are--only that would be a joke, and I know I should spoil it,"" says John . The Stranger had long white hair, good features, bold and well defined for an old man Tilly Slowboy, with a melodious cry of ""Ketcher, Ketcher""--performed some cow-like gambols around that all unconscious Innocent . ""Good evening, John!"" said the little man . The Carrier had a wandering and thoughtful eye, a description which will equally apply to his voice . ""I wish it was, or could be!"" cried the Carrier . ""You're here, are you? Wait a bit. I'll take you home,"" said Caleb . He's too busy, courting. ""I think that's all."" Tackleton the Toy merchant was a domestic Ogre, who had been living on children all his life . he had even lost money by getting up Goblin slides for magic lanterns, whereon the Powers of Darkness were depicted as a sort of supernatural shell-fish, with human faces . In spite of all this, he was going ""You'll come to the wedding? We're in the same boat, you know,"" said Tackleton . ""I thought you were never sociable,"" said John in his plain way . We have arranged to keep our Wedding-day at home,"" says John . ""You'll say you'll come? It's as much your interest as mine, you know, that the women should persuade each other that they're quiet and contented, and couldn't be better off,"" said Tackleton . ""I have the humour, sir, to marry a young wife, and a ""I'm glad it's gone,"" muttered Tackleton, turning the expressive eye all round the room . ""Nothing in him at all. Come! Bring that box! All right now, I hope?"" said John Peerybingle . Caleb had been dozing on the cake-box, and stood within a short stride of Dot mused the Carrier as he walked slowly to and fro . He scouted, from his heart, the insinuations of the toy merchant, and filled him with a vague, indefinite uneasiness . ""I know he is, but----Yes, certainly! I'll make him up  CHIRP THE SECOND Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all alone by themselves . The Carrier, in his smoothing forehead and expanding face, acknowledged it . And as the Dutch clock ticked, and as the red fire gleamed, that Genius of his Hearth and Home came out . Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived in Gruff and Tackleton . The Blind Girl never knew that iron was rusting, wood rotting, paper peeling off . But the Blind Girl lived in the belief of an eccentric humorist who loved to have his jest with them . Caleb Plummer and his daughter were at work together in their usual working-room . There were houses in it, finished and unfinished, for Dolls of all stations in life . Some of these establishments could be fitted on the most expensive scale, at a moment's notice . Caleb Plummer and his daughter sat at work in the midst of all these objects . The Blind Girl rested from her work, and laughed with delight . ""I see you, father! Bless your Honour! "" I'm half ashamed to wear it, though"" ""I know you, father! Ha, ha, ha! I've found you out, you see!"" said Caleb . ""You are speaking quite softly. You are not tired, father?"" said Tackleton . he hummed a fragment of a song, which made his face a thousand times more thoughtful than ever . ""The extent to which he's winking at this moment!"" whispered Caleb to his daughter . ""Oh! you're there, are you?"" answered Tackleton . He founded the belief, I can't say whether consciously or not . ""I want to bring the Peerybingles a little more into company with May Fielding,"" muttered Tackleton . ""I'm going to be married to May!"" cried the Blind Girl in an ecstasy . Caleb had drooped her head, and turned away; so stood, with her hands ""You have your working dress on, and are not so gallant as when you wear the handsome coat?"" said Bertha, touching him . ""Her hair is dark,"" said Caleb, drawing close to his side, and stealing one arm round his neck . Mrs. Peerybingle and Miss Slowboy took advantage of the Baby's inaction . he was recalled, shining very much and roaring violently, to partake of . By this time, the Baby, being all alive again, was invested, by the united efforts . ""John! You've got the basket with the Veal and Ham Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer?"" said Dot . ""I am sorry for it, John!"" said Mrs. Peerybingle. ""Please!"" ""I declare I wouldn't go to Bertha's"" John Peerybingle's errand cart was numerous; there were many stoppages to take them in and give them out, which were not by any means the worst parts of the journey . Boxer gave occasion to more good-natured recognitions of, and by, the Carrier, than half-a-dozen Christians could have done  It's astonishing how much you may see in a thicker fog than that, if you will only take the trouble to look for it . Not the Baby, I'll be sworn; for it's not in Baby nature to be warmer or more sound asleep, though its capacity is great in both respects, than that blessed young Peerybingle Dot Fielding and the Blind Girl were in the town waiting to receive them . Tackleton was a man of taste, beyond all question . She was very pretty, and she was very genteel and patronising . ""Dear, dear, what changes! To talk of those merry school days makes one young again,"" said Dot . ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry, when I think what silly girls we were"" Caleb sat next his daughter; Dot and her old schoolfellow were side by side; the good Carrier took care of ""I never fixed on John, I'm sure; I never so much as thought of him,"" says Dot . ""You couldn't help yourselves, for all that."" ""Some of them are dead,"" said Dot, ""and some of them forgotten"" ""You could not resist us, you see,"" says Tackleton . John Peerybingle proposed to-morrow: the Wedding-day, and called them to drink a bumper to it, before he proceeded on his way home . ""Good-bye, John,"" returned Caleb, bending down to kiss the child, and kissing the child . He clapped his sounding hands, "" ""Why, what a clumsy Dot you are this afternoon!"" cried the Blind Girl, bursting into tears . ""I have never felt it in its fulness. Never! They have passed away, and left me tranquil and contented,"" said Caleb . ""I cannot hold it closed and shut within myself,"" said Bertha . ""Look into my face, Dear heart, Sweet heart!"" says Bertha. ""There is not, in my soul, a grateful recollection stronger than the deep remembrance which is stored there of the many times when you have had consideration for Blind Bertha!"" May Fielding, Mrs. Fielding, Tilly, will tell her all about the management of Babies, she says . Tackleton had walked out, and delivered more infallible domestic recipes and precepts than would have destroyed that Young Peerybingle . she was so deference to her experience, that after a short affectation of humility, she began to  Bertha had been listening intently, and Caleb was fonder of his little wife than ever . ""He's the best company on earth to talk secrets in,"" says the Carrier . The Carrier was in high spirits, good fellow that he was . ""I wish he had a better subject, John,"" cried the jovial John . ""I am sorry to disturb you--but a word directly,"" returned the Carrier . The Carrier looked him in the face, and recoiled a step as if he hadn't been struck . CHIRP THE THIRD The Dutch clock in the corner struck Ten when the Carrier sat down by his fireside . Tackleton saw them stop, and saw her turn--to have the face, the face he loved so, so presented to his view! He clenched his strong right hand at first, as if it would have  The Stranger was under his outraged roof, now cold and dark, other and fiercer thoughts began to rise within him . It was an ill-timed thought, bad for the dark mood of his mind . He was the younger man; some lover who had won the heart that _he_ had never touched . The more he felt this, the stronger rose his wrath against his enemy . He looked about him for a weapon, and moved a pace or two towards the door of the perfidious Stranger's room . Turning water into blood, love into hate, gentleness into blind ferocity. ""This has been a happy home, John! and I love the Cricket for its sake!'"" ""Otherwise I never could have loved her as I did,"" returned the Carrier . ""All things that speak the language of your hearth and home _must_ plead for her!"" returned the Cricket . The Fairy figures turned upon him all at once, and seemed to say, ""Is this the light wife you are mourning for?"" There were sounds of gaiety outside, musical instruments, and noisy tongues, and laughter . Dot was the fairest of them all; as young as any of them too . She laughed, and pointed to her cookery on the The Blind Girl's love for her, and her own good busy way of setting Bertha's thanks aside . They showed her to him sitting on her favourite seat, with her bent head, her hands clasped on her brow, her falling hair . When they found her so, they neither turned nor looked upon him, but gathered close round her . All ""John Peerybingle!"" said Tackleton, alighting . ""You are not married before noon,"" said the Carrier . Tilly Slowboy was rapping at the Stranger's door, which was only removed by a few steps . ""I hope there has been nothing--nothing rash in the night?"" says Tackleton . ""I think he has got off pretty easy,"" says the Carrier . he confessed to having had my suspicions always,"" he said . ""You had best not interrupt me,"" says the Carrier . ""I took her--at her age, and with her beauty -- to shut her up from day to day in my dull house"" ""I wish I never had! For her sake; not for mine!"" says Tackleton . ""I can release her from the daily pain of an unequal marriage, and the struggle to conceal it,"" said Tackleton . ""I sat upon that hearth, last night, all night,"" exclaimed the Carrier . In an unhappy moment, taken by surprise, and wanting time to think of what she did, she made herself a party to his treac ""No hand can make the clock which will strike again for me the hours that are gone,"" muttered Tackleton . ""I must be off, for, when the clock strikes again, it'll be necessary for me to be upon my way to church,"" replied the Carrier .

The Tower of London," The plot begins with Lady Jane Grey, wife of Guilford Dudley and daughter-in-law to the Duke of Northumberland, as she enters the Tower of London on 10&nbsp;July 1553. Prior to her entrance into the Tower, she ruled as Queen of England for nine days after she and her husband were put on the throne by the Duke of Northumberland. Soon after, Mary I was able to take control of England and sent the Duke to be executed. Dudley, in order to gain back the kingdom, formed a rebellion, which results in failure and the imprisonment of both himself and his wife. After the imprisonment, Simon Renard, the Spanish Ambassador to England, arranges a marriage between Mary and Philip of Spain in order to bring a Catholic take over of England. The events of the book alternate between historical background and the plot of Lady Jane. In Book II, incidents throughout the history of England from William the Conqueror to the 1820 Cato Street conspiracy are mentioned. The novel returns to Lady Jane busying herself with prayer as she awaits her execution with her only hope for freedom is to become a Catholic. * Lady Jane Grey * Guilford Dudley * John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland * Mary I * Philip of Spain * Xit (Sir Narcissus Le Grand) * Og, Gog and Magog * Winwike * Cuthbert Cholmondeley * Mistress Cicely * Nightgall * Elizabeth The novel is illustrated with 40 engravings and 58 woodcuts by Cruikshank. The illustrations depict moments from the story while the woodcuts show off architectural features related to the Tower. Ainsworth was grateful for the illustrations to the novel, and he wrote in the preface that ""it was no slight satisfaction to him, that circumstances at length enabled him to carry into effect his favourite project, in conjunction with the inimitable artist whose designs accompany the work.""
","The Tower of London is so closely bound up with the history of England, from the Norman Conquest onwards, that it is very difficult to write a record of the one . A full history of the Tower may read like an attenuated I have attempted no pictorial description of the Tower as a whole or in its several parts . Mr. Fulleylove has relieved me of that duty, he has done with the brush infinitely better than I could do it with the Insensible, I trow, As a sentinel should be, Though a queen to save her head should come a-suing; There’s a legend on its brow That is eloquent to Shakespeare might have laid all the scenes of another _Hamlet_ within its walls; Scott might have given its name to another Waverley Novel . If Scott had touched it we should have been spared the gloomy sentimentalities of Sir Walter, this is too scant an excuse to drive us out of one of the most wonderful buildings in the world . The tide carried them up under a dark and lowering arch, closed at the upper end by the well-known Traitor Shakespeare brings us to the Tower four times in the course of the three parts of _King Henry VI._ and four times during _Richard III. In the first act, we are taken into the “room in the Tower” in which The history of the Tower, as the history of other places, will give us names of famous men and the numbering of years in plenty, but of the inner everyday life of some early century there--nothing . It is only the skil We have been led down a by-way in Tower history by plot and counter-plot, with fragrant music for our cheer . The White Tower will re-appear in the child’s dreams as a branch of the Army and Navy The Tower buildings at the present day have been treated in a manner that destroys all illusion . The attempt has been made to convert the old buildings into dwelling-places with modern comforts, and to accommodate there not only the families of the ward a commercial age has committed one unforgivable crime in pulling down Crosby Hall to erect a bank . Our fear may well be lest the modernising of the Tower destroy our sense of the value of any of the I dwell on these points in order to show how hopeless it is to catch any of the real spirit and message of the Tower when to-day is ever intruding itself . we ask for leisure to contemplate a far-off yesterday, The Conqueror set Gundulf, a well-travelled monk of the monastery of Bec, to work on the low ground between the hill and the river .

At this early period of its history, it was found that a collection of wild beasts would lend some zest to life within its walls . It Henry’s Wharf and St. Thomas’s Tower were restored to this day . The wisdom of what had been done was soon made manifest . Eleanor was avaricious, proud, arrogant, and so defied Lord Mortimer, a Welsh prisoner, contrived to escape from his dungeon by the old expedient of making his jailors drunk . He escaped to France, but soon returned, and with Edward’s Queen King John of France, and Philip, his son, were brought captives here in 1358 . Both were set free in 1360 by the Treaty of Bretigny . Richard II. began his reign amid great rejoicings Archbishop Sudbury was celebrating Mass when the mob caught him, dragged him forth from the altar, and despatched him on Tower Hill . Treasurer Hales was also killed, and both heads were exposed on the gateway of old London King Robert died of a broken heart when he heard of his son’s captivity . He became _de facto_ King of Scotland while unjustly immured in Henry’s prison-house .

The jailor dressed each time the pigeon the cat provided, and the prisoner was no longer an-hungered The Tower was never more prominent in England’s records than during Tudor reign . The early years of the new King were to be remembered by an imprisonment in Tower walls that had little sense of justice as excuse . When the Duke of Clarence was put to Henry VIII. was now on the throne, at the age of eighteen, and once again the Tower looms largely in the view . It is admirably exemplified at the beginning of Henry’s reign, Buckingham heard this terrible form of punishment with calmness, and said so should traitors be spoken unto, but that he was never one . Twelve years later Tower Green was given over to revelry; laughter, singing, and mumming The “Pilgrimage of Grace” caused many a leader to be confined within the Tower . The magnificent Abbeys of Rievaulx, Fountains, and Jervaulx were pulled down . Other prisoners were Lords The Tower was becoming like a monster whose craving for human blood was hard to satisfy . Cromwell was taken from the House of Lords to the Tower, and the angry King would listen to no word in his favour .

She had twice swooned, and her limbs had been so stretched and her joints so injured, that she was never again able to Thomas, Lord Seymour, brother of Somerset and uncle of the King, was immured in the Tower, and beheaded on Tower Hill on March 20, 1549 .

She had been wedded to Northumberland’s fourth son, Lord Guildford Dudley . The weaker was pitted against the Wyatt, captured at Temple Bar after a night march from Kingston, was soon in the Tower .

Her father was seized and Lady Jane Grey paced up and down before being set free of the Beauchamp Tower . The Countess of Lennox was imprisoned three times within the walls, ""not for any treason, but for love In 1581 Father Campion, a Jesuit, was hurried to death, and in 1583 we hear of one captive committing suicide in order to escape the awful fate of dismemberment that many of his fellow-prisoners had suffered a delightful description of the state of England at the coming of the King of Scotland to the English throne is given in Mr. G.

It was within this tower that the young Princes disappeared in July, 1483 Sir Walter Raleigh was a captive in the Bloody Tower from 1604-1616 . In 1610 he was kept a close prisoner for three months, and his wife and child were no longer allowed to share his captivity . The Sir Thomas Overbury was poisoned in 1613, one of the blackest crimes that stain Tower history . In the Bloody Tower Sir Thomas was brought to the same tower . Overbury had been a friend of Raleigh’s, and The Wakefield Tower has tragedy and misery enough in its records to deserve its name . It is a mistake on the part of Tower authorities to allow so interesting a building to be closed altogether to the public . In former times the tower had been The White Tower or Keep is the very heart and centre of the Tower buildings, and all the lesser towers and connecting walls, making the Inner and Outer Wards are but the means of protection and inviolable security of this ancient keep .

Tower Hill is the oldest parish church in London . It is more than probable that a In early days this church stood on the edge of London; now it is in its very centre . Yet few buildings equally well preserved have altered as little as this old building has .

Far from the Madding Crowd," Gabriel Oak is a young shepherd. With the savings of a frugal life, and a loan, he has leased and stocked a sheep-farm. He falls in love with a newcomer eight years his junior, Bathsheba Everdene, a proud beauty who arrives to live with her aunt, Mrs. Hurst. She comes to like him well enough, and even saves his life once, but when he makes her an unadorned offer of marriage, she refuses; she values her independence too much and him too little. Gabriel's blunt protestations only serve to drive her to haughtiness. After a few months, she moves to Weatherbury, a village some miles off. When next they meet, their circumstances have changed drastically. An inexperienced new sheep dog drives Gabriel's flock over a cliff, ruining him. After selling off everything of value, he manages to settle all his debts, but emerges penniless. He seeks employment at a work fair in the town of Casterbridge (a fictionalised version of Dorchester). When he finds none, he heads to another fair in Shottsford, a town about ten miles from Weatherbury. On the way, he happens upon a dangerous fire on a farm and leads the bystanders in putting it out. When the veiled owner comes to thank him, he asks if she needs a shepherd. She uncovers her face and reveals herself to be none other than Bathsheba. She has recently inherited the estate of her uncle and is now a wealthy woman. Though somewhat uncomfortable, she hires him. Meanwhile, Bathsheba has a new admirer: the lonely and repressed William Boldwood. Boldwood is a prosperous farmer of about forty whose ardour Bathsheba unwittingly awakens when – her curiosity piqued because he has never bestowed on her the customary admiring glance – she playfully sends him a valentine sealed with red wax on which she has embossed the words ""Marry me"". Boldwood, not realising the valentine was a jest, becomes obsessed with Bathsheba, and soon proposes marriage. Although she does not love him, she toys with the idea of accepting his offer; he is, after all, the most eligible bachelor in the district. However, she postpones giving him a definite answer. When Gabriel rebukes her for her thoughtlessness, she fires him. When her sheep begin dying from bloat, she discovers to her chagrin that Gabriel is the only man who knows how to cure them. Her pride delays the inevitable, but finally she is forced to beg him for help. Afterwards, she offers him back his job and their friendship is restored. At this point, the dashing Sergeant Francis ""Frank"" Troy returns to his native Weatherbury and by chance encounters Bathsheba one night. Her initial dislike turns to infatuation after he excites her with a private display of swordsmanship. Gabriel observes Bathsheba's interest in the young soldier and tries to discourage it, telling her she would be better off marrying Boldwood. Boldwood becomes aggressive towards Troy and she goes to Bath to prevent Troy returning to Weatherbury, as she fears Troy may be harmed on meeting Boldwood. On their return, Boldwood offers his rival a large bribe to give up Bathsheba. Troy pretends to consider the offer, then scornfully announces they are already married. Boldwood withdraws humiliated and vows revenge. Bathsheba soon discovers that her new husband is an improvident gambler with little interest in farming. Worse, she begins to suspect that he does not love her. In fact, Troy's heart belongs to her former servant, Fanny Robin. Before meeting Bathsheba, Troy had promised to marry Fanny; on the wedding day, however, the luckless girl goes to the wrong church. She explains her mistake, but Troy, humiliated at being left waiting at the altar, angrily calls off the wedding. When they part, unbeknownst to Troy, Fanny is pregnant with his child. Some months afterward, Troy and Bathsheba encounter Fanny on the road, destitute, as she painfully makes her way toward the Casterbridge workhouse. Troy sends his wife onward with the horse and gig before she can recognise the girl, then gives her all the money in his pocket, telling her he will give her more in a few days. Fanny uses up the last of her strength to reach her destination. A few hours later, she dies in childbirth, along with the baby. Mother and child are then placed in a coffin and sent home to Weatherbury for interment. Gabriel, who has long known of Troy's relationship with Fanny, tries to conceal the child's existence – but Bathsheba, suspecting the truth and wild with jealousy, arranges for the coffin to be left in her house overnight. When all the servants are in bed, she unscrews the lid and sees the two bodies inside – her husband's former lover and their child. Troy then comes home from Casterbridge, where he had gone to keep his appointment with Fanny. Seeing the reason for her failure to meet him, he gently kisses the corpse and tells the anguished Bathsheba, ""This woman is more to me, dead as she is, than ever you were, or are, or can be."" The next day he spends all his money on a marble tombstone with the inscription ""Erected by Francis Troy in beloved memory of Fanny Robin..."". Then, loathing himself and unable to bear Bathsheba's company, he leaves. After a long walk he bathes in the sea, leaving his clothes on the beach. A strong current carries him away, though he is rescued by a rowing boat. A year later, with Troy presumed drowned, Boldwood renews his suit. Burdened with guilt over the pain she has caused him, Bathsheba reluctantly consents to marry him in six years, long enough to have Troy declared dead. Troy, however, is not dead. When he learns that Boldwood is again courting Bathsheba, he returns to Weatherbury on Christmas Eve to claim his wife. He goes to Boldwood's house, where a party is underway, and orders Bathsheba to come with him; when she shrinks back in surprise, he seizes her arm, and she screams. At this, Boldwood shoots Troy dead and tries unsuccessfully to turn the gun on himself. Although he is condemned to hang for murder, his friends petition the Home Secretary for mercy, citing insanity. This is granted and Boldwood's sentence is changed to ""confinement during Her Majesty's pleasure"". Bathsheba, profoundly chastened by guilt and grief, buries her husband in the same grave as Fanny and their child, and adds a suitable inscription. Throughout her tribulations, she comes to rely more and more on her oldest and (as she admits to herself) only real friend, Gabriel. When he gives notice that he is leaving her employ for California, she finally realises how important he has become to her well-being. That night, she goes alone to visit him in his cottage, to find out why he is (in her eyes) deserting her. Pressed, he reluctantly reveals that it is because people have been injuring her good name by gossiping that he wants to marry her. She exclaims that it is ""...too absurd – too soon – to think of, by far!"" He bitterly agrees that it is absurd, but when she corrects him, saying that it is only ""too soon"", he is emboldened to ask once again for her hand in marriage. She accepts, and the two are quietly wed.

Measure for Measure," Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna, makes it known that he intends to leave the city on a diplomatic mission. He leaves the government in the hands of a strict judge, Angelo. Claudio, a young nobleman, is betrothed/unofficially married to Juliet. At the time, marriages were supposed to be announced by banns in advance. Due to lack of money, Claudio and Juliet did not observe all the technicalities. This did not make them unique however; at the time most people (including the Church) would have considered them married. Technically, however, all the formalities for a civil marriage had not been followed and so a strict judge might rule that they were not legally married. Angelo, as the personification of the law, decides to enforce the ruling that fornication is punishable by death, and since he does not accept the validity of the marriage, Claudio is sentenced to be executed. Claudio's friend, Lucio, visits Claudio's sister, Isabella, a novice nun, and asks her to intercede with Angelo on Claudio's behalf. Isabella obtains an audience with Angelo, and pleads for mercy for Claudio. Over the course of two scenes between Angelo and Isabella, it becomes clear that he harbours lustful thoughts about her, and he eventually offers her a deal: Angelo will spare Claudio's life if Isabella yields him her virginity. Isabella refuses, but she also realises that (due to Angelo's austere reputation) she will not be believed if she makes a public accusation against him. Instead she visits her brother in prison and counsels him to prepare himself for death. Claudio vehemently begs Isabella to save his life, but Isabella refuses. As a novice nun, she feels that she cannot sacrifice her own immortal soul (and that of Claudio's, if he causes her to lose her virtue) to save Claudio's transient earthly life. The Duke has not in fact left the city, but remains there disguised as a friar (Lodowick) in order to spy on the city's affairs, and especially on the actions of Angelo. In his guise as a friar he befriends Isabella and arranges two tricks to thwart Angelo's evil intentions: #First, a ""bed trick"" is arranged. Angelo has previously refused to fulfill the betrothal binding him to Mariana, because her dowry had been lost at sea. Isabella sends word to Angelo that she has decided to submit to him, making it a condition of their meeting that it occurs in perfect darkness and in silence. Mariana agrees to take Isabella's place, and she has sex with Angelo, although he continues to believe he has enjoyed Isabella. (In some interpretations of the law, this constitutes consummation of their betrothal, and therefore their marriage. This is the same interpretation that assumes that Claudio and Juliet are legally married.) #After having sex with Mariana (who he thinks is Isabella), Angelo goes back on his word, sending a message to the prison that he wishes to see Claudio's head, and necessitating the ""head trick."" The Duke first attempts to arrange the execution of another prisoner whose head can be sent instead of Claudio's. However, the villain Barnardine refuses to be executed in his drunken state. As luck would have it, a pirate named Ragozine, of similar appearance to Claudio, has recently died of a fever, so his head is sent to Angelo instead. This main plot concludes with the 'return' to Vienna of the Duke as himself. Isabella and Mariana publicly petition him, and he hears their claims against Angelo, which Angelo smoothly denies. As the scene develops, it appears that Friar Lodowick will be blamed for the 'false' accusations levelled against Angelo. The Duke leaves Angelo to judge the cause against Lodowick, but returns in disguise moments later when Lodowick is summoned. Eventually the friar reveals himself to be the Duke, thereby exposing Angelo as a liar and Isabella and Mariana as truthful. He proposes that Angelo be executed but first compels him to marry Mariana— with his estate going to Mariana as her new dowry, ""to buy you a better husband"". Mariana pleads for Angelo's life, even enlisting the aid of Isabella (who is not yet aware her brother Claudio is still living). The Duke pretends not to heed the women's petition, and only after revealing that Claudio has not, in fact, been executed, relents. The Duke then proposes marriage to Isabella. Isabella does not reply, and her reaction is interpreted differently in different productions: her silent acceptance of his proposal is the most common in performance. This is one of the ""open silences"" of the play. A sub-plot concerns Claudio's friend Lucio, who frequently slanders the duke to the friar, and in the last act slanders the friar to the duke, providing opportunities for comic consternation on Vincentio's part and landing Lucio in trouble when it is revealed that the duke and the friar are one and the same. His punishment, like Angelo's, is to be forced into an undesired marriage: in this case with the prostitute Kate Keepdown.

The Scapegoat," 'I left the car by the side of the cathedral, and then walked down the steps into the Place des Jacobins. It was still raining hard. It had not once let up since Tours, and all I had seen of the countryside I loved was the gleaming surface of the route nationale, rhythmically cut by the monotonous swing of the windscreen-wiper. Outside Le Mans, the depression that had grown upon me during the past twenty-fours had intensified.' (p.1) The Scapegoat is narrated by John, an Englishman and lecturer in French history at a London university, who is coming to the end of his holiday in France. He arrives in Le Mans, depressed and melancholy at the thought of returning to his lectures: 'the real meaning of history would have escaped me, because I had never been close enough to people' (p.1). John feels lonely, isolated, and as though his outward life is a meaningless facade. 'I lived and breathed and had my being as a law-abiding, quiet, donnish individual of thirty-eight. But to the self who clamoured for release, the man within? How did my poor record seem to him? [...] Perhaps, if I had not kept him locked within me, he might have laughed, roistered, fought and lied' (p.10). John considers concluding his visit at the Abbaye de la Grande-Trappe where he hopes to find some consolation but as he crosses the road in Le Mans the driver of a car calls out to him, addressing him as Jean. John tries to explain to the man who seems to know him that there has been a mistake but the man takes it to be a deliberate deception, winks, laughs and drives away. He enters the station buffet and is confronted by another man: 'I realised, with a strange sense of shock and fear and nausea all combined, that his face and voice were known to me too well. I was looking at myself' (p.13). John has a premonition that meeting his double could be 'fraught with tragedy, like the Man in the Iron Mask' (p.14) but he sits down and has a drink with his doppelganger, to whom he begins to confess his feelings of depression and failure. His double mistakes him for a Frenchman because of his excellent grasp of the language and they eventually retire to a backstreet hotel where they continue to drink and eventually swap clothes. John falls to the floor drunk and when he awakes, he discovers a chauffeur at the door: 'Monsieur le Comte is awake at last?' (p.27). John realises that his double has disappeared with his clothing and he attempts to convince the chauffeur that he is not the Comte. The chauffeur believes him to be drunk and when he enquires after the 'gentleman I was with last night' (p.30) the hotel receptionist has no knowledge of him. John decides that if 'he wished to make an idiot of me, I would do the same to him. I would put on his clothes and drive his car to hell - as he was no doubt driving mine - and have myself arrested, and then wait for him to turn up and explain his senseless action as best he could' (p.31). Ignoring further opportunities to explain his predicament, John shaves, dresses, gets in the car and they make for the chateau at St Gilles. He realises that Jean de Gué 'had given me what I asked, the chance to be accepted. He had lent me his name, his possessions, his identity. I had told him my own life was empty: he had given me his' (p.34). They arrive at the chateau and John is met by a man named Paul, Jean's brother, who appears irritated by his lateness. John enters the house and goes into a room in which three women are seated. One, named Blanche, leaves as soon as he enters; the second, a fair-haired woman, who is pregnant, tells him that they have been worried about his absence; and the third, dark-haired, exchanges a knowing glance with him. The women inform him that Marie-Noel has a fever and when asked about Paris he declares carelessly: 'I have no idea what happened in Paris. I'm suffering from memory loss' (p.41). The pregnant woman expresses her hope that he has reached an agreement in Paris but John continues to taunt the women: 'Actually, I am not Jean de Gué at all. I am someone else. We met in Le Mans last night, and changed clothes, and he has disappeared in my car, heaven knows where, and I am here in his place. You must admit it's an extraordinary situation' (p.42). The women take no notice, believing him to be suffering from a hangover, and eventually John admits that he drank too much in Le Mans and leaves the room. Venturing upstairs, John finds himself in a bare room decorated only with religious paraphernalia: a painting of the scourging of Christ, a crucifix, and a small alcove for prayer. A servant discovers him and asks, looking rather surprised, if he is searching for Mademoiselle Blanche. He is told that she is with the Madame la Comtesse who is eager to see him and will not wait. He follows the servant into a room in which 'a massive elderly women, her flesh sagging in a hundred lines, but her eyes, her nose, her mouth so astonishingly and horribly like my own that for one wild moment I believed after all Jean de Gué had come up here before me and was masquerading as a final jest' (p.46). John intuits that the woman is Jean's mother and when she presses him as to whether he has renewed the contract; he tells her that everything has been arranged. She pesters him for a present that he has brought her from Paris and then they dine. She tells him that Marie-Noel has been having visions and that 'she kept telling Françoise and Renée that you were not coming back' (p.52). Blanche, who has been sitting with Madame la Comtesse while the local priest attended her, declares that she will inform the bishop if Marie-Noel continues to have visions of the Virgin Mary. The mother's maid, Charlotte, presses John for the package and he leaves the room, fortuitously stumbling upon Jean's dressing room where he discovers a number of parcels, marked F, R, B, P, M-N, and Maman. He returns with the parcel but Charlotte intercepts it and takes it away. When he returns to the dressing room he discovers that the pregnant woman is Françoise and that rather than being Paul's wife, as he had assumed, she is in fact Jean's wife. John gives her the package marked 'F' which turns out to be a locket brooch containing a miniature of himself/Jean. Françoise is pleased but confesses her deep unhappiness to John. When she falls asleep, John goes out into the corridors of the chateau and is accosted by Renée, the dark haired woman, who says: 'I waited for you, leaving my door open. Didn't you see it?' (p.64). John brushes her off and she storms away upstairs. He goes out onto the terrace at the back of the house and is suddenly pelted by chestnuts, by a kneeling figure in an upstairs window. He looks closer and discovers that it is a child who declares: 'I swear to you, that if you don't come to me by the time I count a hundred, I shall throw myself out of the window' (p.67). John rushes inside and finds the child, who looks like Jean de Gué in miniature and calls him 'Papa'; the child is Marie-Noel. She is affectionate and playful with him but notices that his hands and smell are different. She tells him that she had a vision of the Virgin Mary who told her that her father would not return. She declares that she would have killed herself if he had not returned: 'And then I should have burnt in hell. But I would rather burn in hell than live in this world without you' (p.71). Her room, like Blanche's, also contains a crucifix, a prie-dieu, and pictures of the saints. John returns to his bedroom and opens the package marked M-N, it is a book called 'The Little Flower' about St Therese Lisieux. John thinks that Jean acted wrongly to escape from the chateau- 'none of these people under his roof would be behaving as they had behaved tonight but for something he had done to them' (p.76)-but he sees an opportunity for himself to put it right. When John awakes the next morning, Gaston tells him that Paul will be expecting him at the verrerie (the glass-works) in the afternoon. John gives Marie-Noel her present and declares that he will give all the other presents at lunchtime, although Marie-Noel is surprised that there is one for Blanche. At lunch, the content of Renée's package- a lace nightgown- upsets the party and there is further embarrassment when Marie-Noel reads the label on Paul's present- a remedy for impotence. Blanche does not open her parcel. John realises his mistake and leaves with Paul for the verrerie. He apologises for the mistake but Paul remains furious. At the verrerie, John discovers that the reason for Jean's visit to Paris was to attempt to save the business by renegotiating a contract with a firm called Carvalet to sell their glass. Despite having no idea as to the outcome of Jean's meeting, John tells Paul that he has renewed the contract and that production can continue as normal. Paul is delighted. John interrogates Jacques who works at the foundry and discovers that the verrerie is a liability and that unlike Jean's father, and Monsieur Duval who managed affairs previously, the Comte's management of the business has been non-existent. He then meets some of the workers at the foundry including Julie and her son-in-law André who had been badly injured in an accident. Back at the chateau, John reads the letter from Carvalet and discovers that they had declined to renew the contract and that the visit to Paris had been a failure. John decides to rectify the situation. He rings Carvalet and tells them that he will accept their terms, despite running the verrerie at a loss. He suspects that someone has overheard his phone call but he cannot locate the other extension. He rummages through Jean's desk in search of some information about his finances but instead finds a photograph album featuring himself, Paul, and Blanche as children, and a man named Maurice. Renée comes into the library and berates him for giving her the lingerie at the dinner table. John suddenly realises that Jean was having an affair with her and he attempts again to brush her off. He goes to see Marie-Noel and discovers that Blanche had opened her package. Inside was a bottle of perfume and a note: 'For my beautiful Béla, from Jean'. Marie-Noel also lets slip in conversation that Jean had not spoken to Blanche in fifteen years and John muses: 'no wonder the giving of a present had been out of character. The revelation was disturbing, even sinister, especially when I remembered the snapshots of the two children with their arms about each other. Something personal and bitter had come between Blanche and Jean de Gué, yet it was accepted by all, even by the child' (p.127). When John puts Marie-Noel to bed she tells him that she had sinned by threatening to kill herself and she attempts to perform penance by beating herself with a leather whip. Appalled by the effects which Blanche's religion is having on his daughter, John delivers the whip back to her only to find the door slammed in his face. John decides to spend his second night at the chateau sleeping in the dressing room. 'I knew that everything I had said or done had implicated me further, driven me deeper, bound me more closely still to that man whose body was not my body, whose mind was not my mind, whose thoughts and actions were a world apart, and yet whose inner substance was part of my nature, part of my secret self' (p.138). The next morning John decides to go to the bank in Villars to investigate his double's finances. Renée contrives to go with him but John encourages Marie-Noel to join the party. Marie-Noel is delighted but when doing cartwheels in her mother's room, smashes two ornaments. Françoise is upset and lashes out at the child, telling her that when the baby arrives, she will take second place. John takes the pieces of the ornaments with him, parcelled up in some discarded paper he found in the dressing room, hoping to arrange for them to be mended in Villars. Renée is annoyed that she and Jean/John are to be chaperoned by the child and she goes off to the hairdressers. Marie-Noel visits the antique shop to see if they can fix the ornaments while Jean goes to the bank. In his vault he discovers the marriage settlement relating to Jean and Françoise. He discovers that Françoise's dowry was in trust for a male heir and that Jean would only come into the money otherwise if Françoise reached the age of fifty having only given birth to daughters or if she died. John understands why it is crucial for Françoise's baby to be a boy and why she is anxious about the pregnancy. John leaves the bank, having been told that Marie-Noel had already left town in a lorry going back to the verrerie. He goes over to speak to the blonde woman who he presumes owns the antique shop where Marie-Noel left the ornaments. She ushers him inside and declares: 'That child of yours is adorable but it was very naughty of you to send her here. Any why for heaven's sake did you wrap up those pieces of broken porcelain in cellophane and paper with a card addressed to me?' (p.155). John inadvertently wrapped the pieces in the paper containing the note to 'Béla' from Jean. He realises that this woman in Villars is Béla and she is another of the Comte's mistresses. John tells Béla the truth about the Carvalet contract and she asks him why the sudden concern for the verrerie and its workforce. She tells him that she has always wondered whether his lack of interest in the place was because of what happened to Maurice Duval. John encourages her to keep talking and she mentions that he died during the Occupation. He tries to tell her about the change that has come over him/Jean and that he is a different person. Béla replies 'you aren't the only one with a dual personality. We all have multiple selves. But no one avoids responsibility that way. The problems remain to be tackled just the same' (p.164). When John returns to the house, he discovers that the doctor who had called to see Françoise has already left and he has ordered her to remain in bed in order to protect the baby. He goes to talk to Françoise and tells her that he had a long meeting at the bank which prevented him from being home in time, and he confesses about the Carvalet contract. Françoise is pleased that he confided in her and she then asks if he looked at the marriage settlement when he was in the vault. He says that he did and she asks whether he will inherit the money if she dies. '""What happens if I die? You get everything, don't you?"" ""You're not going to die""' (p.172). John goes to see Jean's mother and when he mentions that perhaps Françoise should see a specialist if the pregnancy is going to present problems, she says slyly 'Whatever for?' (p.176). They are interrupted by a telephone call from Dr Lebrun. He tells John that Françoise needs complete rest. Marie-Noel asks why the servants are gossiping about the baby dying and she asks why they need to have another baby. John replies honestly that it is because of the money they will receive from the marriage settlement. John returns upstairs to sit with Françoise rather than brave Paul and Renée in the salon. She is touched, if a little surprised, by the concern. The following day he goes down to the verrerie to go through the figures with Jacques in the office and he then asks about the rest of the disused house. He finds a box of books, one of which is inscribed 'Maurice Duval', and he asks Jacques why they don't make the house inhabitable. He replies that 'there are not very happy memories connected with the house when it was last inhabited. Few people would wish to live there now [...] When the last man to live here, the master of the verrerie, Monsieur Duval, is woken from his bed in the middle of the night, and taken downstairs and shot by his own countrymen, and his body thrown into the well cut to pieces with his own glass, even if it happened a long time ago and is something we all prefer to forget, yet it does not make anybody very anxious to come and live here, where it happened, bringing a wife and family' (p.189). John signs the new contract from Carvalet and puts it in the post. He then goes to talk to Julie and asks her about the Occupation. She shows him a snapshot of a young German officer whose coat she cleaned so that he would not get in trouble with his superiors. The villagers ostracised her two years afterwards: 'so you see, when war comes to one's own village, one's own doorstep, it isn't tragic and impersonal any longer. It's just an excuse to vomit private hatred' (p.194). When he returns to the chateau, the servants ask John about the arrangements for the annual shoot the following day. He has overheard references to the 'grande chasse' during the past few days but he suddenly realises its implications: he, John, cannot shoot. He goes out into the grounds of the chateau, desperate for an excuse not to participate. He sees a fire burning and decides on a rash course of action. He drops Jean's watch into the fire and then thrusts his hand into the flames to retrieve it. He returns inside in great pain, to the shock of the family, especially when they discover that the watch he had wished to save had been a present from Maurice Duval. Blanche dresses the wound and he tells Paul to organise the shoot; now he is injured, he has no interest in it. When he goes to put Marie-Noel to bed, she tells him that she saw him thrusting his hand into the fire on purpose. He tells her that it was because he had not wanted to shoot and she says that he must have been thinking about Duval. When John questions her further she says that she knows he met a horrible death, but that her grandmother had forbidden her from talking about Duval either to her father or to Blanche. She asks if he did it because he didn't want to kill any birds, and when he says that perhaps that was the reason, she is pleased at his courage and his 'great act of humiliation' (p.216). John persuades her not to mention it to any one and Marie-Noel agrees, although she tells him that she thinks his act to be like the sacrificial mortifications of the saints. When the annual shoot begins the next day, John discovers Jean's mother welcoming the guests, who are so surprised by her emergence from the chateau that John's hand goes unnoticed. John is annoyed when she mocks Paul and Renée's attempts to run the shoot but he then finds himself unable to control Jean's dog, César. The dog scatters the birds, to Paul's annoyance, and John returns to the chateau with Gaston, drinking cognac from a hip flask. He meets the man who first mistook him for Jean in Le Mans before the swop took place and on a whim he gives the man his own address in London: '""Any assistance you give this chap you'll be giving to me; we're closer than brothers."" Then I burst out laughing, thinking him extremely stupid not to see the point' (p.229). John is encouraged to give a speech to the guests, which despite his inebriation he does, but they are not amused when he jokes that if he had shot with his damaged hand 'some of you present might never have survived' (p.230). When he returns to the chateau, John is summoned to Jean's mother who appears to be unwell. Her maid is downstairs in the kitchen and the mother urges him to help her, directing him to a drawer. When John opens it he discovers that the package which he brought back from Paris was ampoules of morphine. 'But his mother was not ill or dying, neither was she in pain' (p.234). He reluctantly administers the drug and she loses consciousness. John spends the night in Villars with Béla. He recounts the events of the day and when he recalls his quip about the gun she comments: 'Coming from a one-time Resistance leader to a group of well-known collaborators, it must have sounded curious all the same' (p.245). When he returns to the chateau he discovers a letter from Marie-Noel pushed under his door in which she writes: 'The Sainte Vierge tells me you are unhappy, and are suffering now for wrong done in the past, so I am going to pray that all your sins may be visited upon me, who, being young and strong, can bear them better.' (p.248). When he goes in to Françoise, she tells him that Marie-Noel has disappeared. Everyone goes out to look for Marie-Noel except Françoise. By chance John discovers her down at the house at the verrerie being looked after by Julie, who found her down the well amongst the broken glass after the dog, César, was found there barking. When he expresses surprise about the well and that it has contained no water for fifteen years, he finally discovers the secret of Jean's past. Maurice Duval was shot by Jean and his men: 'poor Monsieur Duval, whose only crime was trying to preserve the verrerie while you were absent, for which you and your little group of patriots called him a collaborator, and shot him, and let him die there in the well' (p.258). John's realises that Marie-Noel had climbed into the well as an act of penitence on behalf of her father. Blanche arrives and looks around her at the house and John suddenly realises that 'what she was looking at had once been part of her life' (p.260): Blanche had had a relationship with Duval. Marie-Noel wakes up and tells John that she had had a dream in which the Virgin Mary told her that her grandmother wanted Françoise to die: 'In the dream I wanted her to die too. So did you. We were all guilty. It was very wicked. Isn't there something you can do to prevent it coming true?' (p.263). At that moment there is a telephone call from the chateau for John to return at once. Françoise has fallen from the bedroom window and been taken to the hospital in Villars. She requires a blood transfusion and when Blanche says that either Jean or Paul could donate because they are the same blood type, John speaks up and denies it. Blanche declares: 'You don't want to save her. You're hoping she'll die' (p.269). Françoise and her baby, which was a boy, both die and John thinks back on his behaviour towards Jean's wife. He is glad he gave her the locket but he regrets that he had done no more. Back at the chateau, John interrogates his mother's maid Charlotte. She says that when Marie-Noel had gone missing, Françoise worried that 'the child might have turned against her. She is too fond of her papa, she said, and of Mademoiselle Blanche' (p.275). Charlotte tells John that she agreed with Françoise and he worries about how this might have affected her. He goes to the bedroom and leans out of the window, wondering whether her death can really have been an accident. Fearing the worst, John goes to interrogate Jean's mother. He forces her into recounting a conversation which she had with Françoise shortly before she died. Madame la Comtesse recalls: '""Does he want me to die so that he can marry someone else?"" she [Françoise] asked at last. I told her I did not know. ""Jean makes love to everyone. He has made love to Renée, even, here in the chateau, and he has a mistress in Villars"" [...] ""So the child isn't the only one to want me out of the way,"" she said, ""Jean does, too, and so do you, and Renée, and the woman in Villars."" I didn't answer her.' (p.283). Jean's mother concludes by saying 'You've got what you wanted, haven't you?' (p.283) but John denies it vehemently. He declares that he needs her help and after considerable effort, he persuades her to resume her position at the head of the family and to give up the morphine. She agrees and goes downstairs to begin making the funeral arrangements. The commissaire de police arrives to investigate Françoise's death. The suspicion of suicide is raised and when Charlotte is interviewed, she lets slip that she had been listening in to John's conversation with Carvalet about the renewal of the contract. Paul is astonished. When the commissaire goes to Françoise's bedroom Marie-Noel is there, having leant out the window and discovered the locket on the ledge. It seems that when leaning out to rescue Jean's present, Françoise fell. Paul confronts John about the Carvalet contract and he tells him the truth. John admits that he/Jean has no head for business and he agrees with Paul that if he had gone to Paris instead, the contract would no doubt have been more favourable. John suggests that Paul take over that part of the business and travel with Renée, while he stays at the chateau. Paul is surprised but he accepts, believing it to be the only way to save his marriage. Later when Renée confronts him, John says that he is not in love with her. She asks him whether he contrived the Carvalet contract in the hope that Françoise would die, and is relieved when he denies the charge. John sits with Jean's mother until she falls asleep as she is beginning to suffer withdrawal symptoms from the morphine. He then goes to see Blanche and while she dresses his hand, he forces her to talk about the past. He tries to apologise but Blanche is still angry, reminding him of his mockery of her and Duval's relationship, and his jealousy when their father made Duval head of the verrerie. John tells Blanche that he wants her to run the verrerie in his place and to live in the master's house. 'The house is waiting there for you. It's been waiting for fifteen years.' (p.326). The next day the funeral arrangements are begun, Blanche goes down to the verrerie, and Renée begins to talk about travelling with Paul. Then there is a telephone call for John. It is Jean de Gué: 'It's me. Jean de Gué. I've just seen today's newspaper. I'm coming back' (p.334). They agree to meet at the master's house at the verrerie. 'Although the emotion that filled me now was violent, over-whelming, yet at the same time I felt deliberate and calm. I was the possessor now, he the intruder. The chateau was my chateau, the people were my people, the family who in a few minutes would sit with me round the table were my family, my flesh and blood; they belonged to me and I to them. He could not return and make them his again' (p.336). John goes into the library and removes a revolver from the desk drawer. He waits in the master's house but when there is a knock at the door, he finds the priest standing there, who takes the gun from his hand. The priest had feared that John might kill himself and he says: 'What good would that do, to you or to them? By living, you can create their world afresh. Already I see signs of it, here in the master's house' (p.343). When the priest leaves, Jean de Gué enters holding a gun and says 'So you planned to get rid of me, did you, and stay in St Gilles?' (p.345). Jean is amazed that John has managed to keep up the deception for seven days and he amuses himself by wondering how John dealt with his various intrigues, and problems with Renée, with Blanche, with Françoise. He mocks John's attempt to take his mother off morphine: 'tonight she'll be a raving maniac', and he thinks that John's plan for Renée and Paul will break up their marriage even sooner: 'Renée will find the lover she's been searching for and Paul feel himself more inferior than ever [...] What want of tact, if I may say so, how lacking in finesse' (pp.347-8). He is more concerned with the Carvalet contract but considers that asking Blanche to run the verrerie might in fact make sound business sense. Jean thinks that John wants to stay at the chateau for the money and comfort, but John says 'I happen to love your family, that's all' (p.349). Jean laughs in disbelief that he could love them, listing their faults: 'Paul, who is an oaf, a weakling, a thoroughly disagreeable personality [...] Blanche, who is so twisted with repressed sex and frustrated passion that the only stimulation she gets out of life is to kneel before a bleeding crucifix' (p.350). John tells Jean to kill him, if that is his wish, and to throw him down the well. Jean is surprised that he has discovered the secret about Duval. He believes that John could not possibly have met Béla, and John does not disabuse him of this notion. He then tells John that during his time in the chateau, he had been to London. Jean stayed in his flat and then sold it, clearing out his bank account and changing the money into francs after fortuitously meeting up with his friend from Le Mans, to whom John had given his London address during the annual shoot. John is astounded: 'unless I liked to make a fool of myself by writing to the university and saying it was all a mistake - that I had decided not to resign after all - I had no work. I had no money, save for one or two investments. I had no flat, and if I didn't get back to London soon I should have no furniture. I did not exist. The self who had lived in London had gone forever' (p.355). Jean admits that in a strange way he missed his family, and the two exchange clothes. Jean suggests that they might make the switch again, from time to time, if they fancied a change. They get into John's car and drive towards the chateau. He tries to tell Jean that his family has changed, but he ignores him. Jean gets out of the car and walks the rest of the way and John sees him greet Marie-Noel as he drives on along the road. John drives to Villars to see Béla. She alone had realised that he was someone else and not the real Jean de Gué. She says that he had a 'tendresse' that Jean did not possess. She says that because of John the family in the chateau will be different, even if Jean tries to undo the good he has done there. John says that Jean is a 'devil' but Béla replies: 'he's not a devil. He's a human, ordinary man, just like yourself' (p.364). She tells him that 'you've given something to all of us [...] Just now I called it tendresse. Whatever it is, it can't be destroyed. It's taken root. It will go on growing. In the future we shall look for you in Jean, not for Jean in you' (pp.364-5). John says that at St Gilles his failure turned into love but 'the problem remains the same. What do I do with love?' (p.367). He leaves resolving to follow his original path to the Abbey de la Grande Trappe. 'I drove to the network of roads at the top of the town, turned left, and took the road to Bellême and Mortagne' (p.368).
","The Scapegoat Author: Richard Maples Release Date: July 13, 2011 . I'm a newspaper man whose job it is to look at things objectively . It was a perfect answer to the damnable criticisms leveled at my series on juvenile delinquency . I was the hero of the incident, a cruel assault on a poor, helpless old man . I asked, ""What happened, Pop? Was he trying to rob you or something?"" I bent down again and pulled him to his feet . My spine went cold. It was his flesh . ""I'm glad,"" Nan said, her face brightening . ""He gave me a lot of bull about it being a mistake to pick on people's children"" Nan slapped the iodine on the table; ""I told him he was jerking the rug from under me"" ""You finally quit!"" I shrugged in a gesture of helplessness . Tommy was born and there were bills to pay, and even the bickering between us had ceased . Nan, of course, was furious, even though I pointed out the extra dough meant we could start planning again . ""You're not being very fair about this. I did it all with you and Tommy in mind,"" Nan said . Tommy was a big kid for his age, mentally and physically . He ran out the kitchen way, slamming the back door so hard, the whole house shook . I invited him to stay for dinner and he accepted . ""He gave me the willies,"" she said . The hero of the affair, to my own son, was Ashe!

The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck," The tale begins in a farmyard which is home to a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs. At the top of a hill, she spies a distant wood, flies to it, and waddles about until she discovers an appropriate nesting place. However, a charming gentleman with ""black prick ears and sandy-coloured whiskers"" persuades her to nest in a shed at his home. Jemima is led to his ""tumble-down shed"" (which is curiously filled with feathers), and makes herself a nest with little ado. Jemima lays her eggs, and the fox suggests a dinner party to mark the event. He asks her to collect the traditional herbs used in stuffing a duck, telling her the seasonings will be used for an omelette. Jemima sets about her errand, but the farm collie, Kep, meets her as she carries onions from the farm kitchen. She reveals her errand, and Kep sees through the fox's plan at once. With the help of two fox-hound puppies, Kep rescues Jemima and the ""foxy-whiskered gentleman"" is chased away and never seen again. However, the hungry fox-hounds eat Jemima's eggs. Jemima is escorted back to the farm in tears over her lost eggs, but, in time, lays more eggs and successfully hatches four ducklings.

The Land of Little Rain," The Land of Little Rain is a collection of short stories and essays detailing the landscape and inhabitants of the American Southwest. A message of environmental conservation and a philosophy of cultural and sociopolitical regionalism loosely links the stories together. ;""The Land of Little Rain"" The opening essay describes the ""Country of Lost Borders,"" an area of land between Death Valley and the High Sierras. The image created of the land at the beginning of the story is one of almost unbearable heat and dryness, punctuated by violent storms. Despite the description of how inhospitable the landscape is, at the end Austin proposes that the costs the land imposes upon a man are worth it because it provides man with peace of mind and body that cannot be achieved any other way. ;""Water Trails of the Ceriso"" The section's title refers to the trails made by wild animals moving towards sources of water. The essay provides descriptions of the many animals that travel along the trails, including coyotes, rabbits, and quails. Their ability to find water where there seems to be none is extolled by Austin, a skill which she believes no human is able to match. ;""The Scavengers"" This essay describes the various animals that live in the desert that feed upon carrion&mdash;most notably, the buzzards and the carrion crows. This scavenging is portrayed as a natural part of the desert, with a multitude of the scavengers working together to find food. The end of the story criticizes the actions of man with regard to the desert. The unnatural trash he leaves cannot used by the scavengers in the story, and as such serves as a stark contrast to the desert's natural processes for recycling waste. ;""The Pocket Hunter"" A pocket hunter is a type of miner who hunts for pockets of ore deposits. In the story, the pocket hunter described by Mary Austin lives off of the land with minimal interactions with the civilized world. This harmony with nature, Austin argues, is essential to the pocket hunter's simple happiness. Despite Austin's muted praise, the pocket hunter wants to strike it rich in order to move to Europe and mingle with the landed elite, a goal he accomplishes. However, by the end of the story, the pocket hunter returns to the desert since it is his ""destiny"". ;""Shoshone Land"" ""Shoshone Land"" narrates the experiences of Winnenap', an American Indian medicine man originally from Shoshone Land who was captured by the Paiute tribe. The story initially revolves around Winnenap', but quickly changes to a detailed description of the environment and wildlife of Shoshone Land to form an intimate tie between Winnenap' and the land he formerly inhabited. ;""Jimville&mdash;a Bret Harte Town"" In the beginning of the section, Jimville is touted as a better source of inspiration for Bret Harte than he found during his own travels. Jimville's inhabitants are likened to the fictional characters that were present in some of Harte's short stories. Austin portrays Jimville as a small town set in a harsh environment and inhabited by simple yet endearing toughs. Although the inhabitants endure many hardships, Austin claims that there is an almost unexplainable pull which keeps them in town and encourages new travelers to stay. ;""My Neighbor's Field"" The story is about a plot of land which changes hands many times&mdash;Austin characterizes this plot of land as an ideal field. She criticizes the owners of the field, the Indians and shepherds, because their habits and lifestyle scar the land. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the field is destined to develop into an urban area. Austin claims that while the field may at that point serve a greater human use, it will not be better for the land and all life. ;""The Mesa Trail"" This section describes one of the trails that runs through the American Southwest. It contains several passages detailing the damage human activity has done to the land. She criticizes the ""unsightly scars"" left by the Paiute Indians in the form of abandoned campoodies and the damaged plant life left by domesticated animals such as sheep. ;""The Basket Maker"" This story follows the life of Seyavi, a Paiute Indian who loses her mate, lives alone with her child, and sells baskets she weaves in order to survive. Austin claims that the Paiutes make the land itself their home, with the natural ridges of mountains as walls and the wild almond bloom as their furnishings. It is because of this that Austin argues that the Paiutes will always be homesick when in homes built by man, as man cannot replicate nature's walls and furnishings. ;""The Streets of the Mountains"" This essay consists of long description of mountains and their respective trails. The section characterizes the beauty of the mountains and their inhabitants. The story also contains critiques people who dwell in man-made houses. The comfort provided by such houses, Austin argues, results in people not being able to truly understand the beauty and divinity of the mountains. ;""Water Borders"" The essay revolves around the streams and lakes that can be found in the mountains, generally formed from the melting snow higher in the mountains. The particular mountain in the story is Oppapago, a mountain within the Sierras in a forest reserve. Austin contrasts the mountain landscape to a meadow outside a forest reserve, which lacks color and beauty because it is damaged by the grazing of sheep. ;""Other Water Borders"" ""Other Water Borders"" is centered more on the plants affected by the water from the mountains, both wild and cultivated. The story begins with a depiction of a squabble between several locals over an irrigation ditch filled by water from the mountains. This is followed by a series of descriptions of the variety of plants that the irrigation ditch allows to thrive. Found within these depictions of plant life is Austin's lament of the complexities of civilization. Austin implies that with the advent of cities and manufactured objects people have lost an innate ability to know what natural remedies may be beneficial or detrimental to one's health. ;""Nurslings of the Sky"" The ""nurslings of the sky"" are storms, formed in the hills and given almost human characteristics by Austin. The beginning of the story contains an account of the destruction of a town by floods and snow. The blame for the events is not placed on nature, but rather the people whose poorly placed town was destroyed. The story continues with descriptions of storms and their effects upon the wildlife of the area, pausing to explain how the land teaches people things. The story uses the example of a group of Native Americans who learn the use of smoke signals by observing the dust pillars formed by desert winds at the edges of mesas. The end of the story expresses Austin's discontent at how people have dealt with the weather by determining the best seasons to plant crops rather than by musing about the ""eternal meanings of the skies"". ;""The Little Town of the Grape Vines"" ""The Little Town of Grape Vines,"" or El Pueblo de Las Uvas, tells a story of a simple people living in peace with their environment. With houses made of mud, homemade wine, and gardens to provide the fruits, vegetables, and herbs, the townspeople live a simple life without the complex notions of wealth and class that Austin feels have corrupted much of society. Austin describes the lives of the people living in the town, lives which consist of little more than planting, harvesting, eating, making music, raising children, and dancing. The end of the story is a call back to the simple life exemplified in ""The Little Town of the Grape Vines,"" criticizing those people who are overly obsessed with their own perceived importance in a world where their actions truly matter little.

There are hills, blunt, burned, squeezed up out of chaos, chrome and vermilion painted, aspiring to the snowline . In all the Western desert edges there are essays in miniature at the famed, terrible Grand Canon This is the country of three seasons . From June on to November it lies hot, still, and unbearable, sick with violent unrelieving storms . The desert floras shame us with their cheerful adaptation to the seasonal limitations . The true desert breeds its own kind, each in its particular habitat . The angle of the slope, the frontage of a hill, the structure of the soil determines the plant . There is neither poverty of soil nor species to account for the sparseness of desert growth . In Death Valley, reputed the very core of desolation, are nearly two hundred identified species . There is no special preponderance of self-fertilized plants, but everywhere the demand for and evidence of insect life . Go as far as you dare in the heart of a lonely land, you cannot go so There is the divinest, cleanest air to be breathed anywhere in God's world . There is promise there of great wealth in ores and earths, which is no wealth by reason of being so far away from water and workable conditions . But men are bewitched by it and tempted to try the impossible . The more you wish of it the more you get, and in the mean time lose much of pleasantness . For all the toll the desert takes of a man it gives compensations, deep breaths and deep sleep . It comes upon one with new force in the pauses of the night that the Chaldeans were a desert Black Mountain is the least fortunate of all heights from which to study trails . There is little water in the Ceriso at the best of times, and that little brackish and smelling vilely . In the dry season there is no water else for a man's long journey of a day . We have fallen on a very careless usage, speaking of wild creatures as if they were bound by some such limitation as hampers clockwork . a coyote in my valley, which is narrow and beset with steep, sharp hills, in long passages steer by the pinnacles of the sky-line . fox or coyote, surprised by its sudden rising from behind the mountain wall, slink in its increasing glow, watch it furtively from the cover of near-by brush, and half uncertain of its identity until it rode clear of the peaks, and finally make off with all the air of one caught napping by a maverick yearling kept on until the season's end, and so betrayed another visitor to the spring that else I might have missed . On a certain morning the half-eaten carcass lay at the foot of the black rock, and in moist earth by the rill of the spring, the foot- the crested quail that troop in the Ceriso are the happiest frequenters of the water trails . It is a laid circle of stones large enough not to be disturbed by any ordinary hap . The rock hereabout is all volcanic, fracturing with a crystalline whitish surface, but Fifty-seven buzzards sat solemnly while the white tilted travelers' vans lumbered down the Canada de los Uvas . The season's end in the dim valley of the San Joaquin is palpitatingly hot, and the air breathes like cotton wool . Through it There are three kinds of noises buzzards make,--it is impossible to call them notes . There is a short croak of alarm, and the same syllable in a modified tone to serve all the purposes of ordinary conversation . The old birds make a kind of throaty chuckling to their a year of green pasture, which is a bad time for the scavengers, saw two buzzards, five ravens, and a coyote feeding on the same carrion crow . Probably we never fully credit the interdependence of wild creatures, and their cognizance of On the Tejon, the Ceriso, and the Little Antelope there were not scavengers enough to keep the country clean .

He had a curious fashion of going about with his mouth open, which gave him a vacant look . he was born with the faculty, and along comes the occasion, like the tap on the test tube  the Pocket Hunter had been looking twenty years ago . he had a friend who had found a good pocket . He had another method in the waterless hills, where he would work out of blind gullies . The Pocket Hunter had been in Grape-vine Canon the year of storms that changed the whole front of the mountain . He felt himself in the grip of an All-wisdom that killed men or spared them as seemed for their good; but of death by sickness he knew nothing except that he believed he should never suffer it  Pocket Hunter was a perfect gossip of the woods, this Pocket Hunter . he knew where he was, but couldn't exactly say . He was on the rise of Waban, knee-deep in sodden snow, and walked on . thief, sneak, and son of a coyote were friendliest words he had for this little gray dog of the wilderness . he believed in the venom of toads, and charms for snake bites . it was so incongruous that I dropped down beside the trail overlook SHOSHONE LAND It is true I have been in Shoshone Land, but before that, long before, I had seen it through the eyes of Winnenap' in a rosy mist of reminiscence, and must always see it with a sense of intimacy in the light that never was Shoshone Land rises in blue hills, blue because thickly wooded with ceanothus and manzanita, the haunt of deer and the border of the Shoshones . Eastward the land goes very far by broken ranges, narrow valleys of pure desertness, and huge mesas uplifte The beginning of spring in Shoshone Land--oh the soft wonder of it!--is a mistiness as of incense smoke . Years of scant rains they lie shut and safe in the winnowed sands . These years the gullies of the hills are rank with fern Winnenap' was medicine-man for fifteen years . he used his prerogatives cunningly with withes to count the stars through . He died, as do most medicine-men of the Paiutes . Winnenap's children were in shallow graves with beads sprinkled over them . There had not been a medicine-man killed in the valley for twelve years . But schooling and native shrewdness raised up in the younger men an unfaith in old usages, so judgment halted between sentence and execution Jimville is about three days from anywhere in particular . Jimville has an atmosphere favorable to the type of a half century back, if not ""forty-niners"" of that breed . It is said that getting away from it is such a piece of work that it encourages permanence in the population . Jimville is a very sharp, steep, ragged-walled ravine . It began around the Bully Boy and Theresa group of mines midway up Squaw Gulch . There are three hundred inhabitants in Jimville and four bars . Jim Calkins found her dying with a three-day babe nozzling at her breast . The stage-driver proved himself really right, though you are not to suppose from this that Jimville had no conventions and no caste . You find him always in possession of your point of view, and with an evident though not Jimville's moral distinctions seem to be a point of honor, with an absence of humorous appreciation . The sheriff was a Jimville man who had shot a man at Lone Tree, fairly, in an open quarrel . ""Side-Winder"" Smith scrubbed the floor for us and moved the Jim Jenkins says the hills are all one, there is gold enough, time enough, and men enough to come after you . Jimville does not know a great deal about the crust of the earth, it prefers a ""hunch"" if you go over a brown back of the hills, by a dripping spring Edswick, Roeder, Connor, and Ruffin owned the field before it fell to my neighbor . After contesting the soil with them, they made a campoodie by the rill of Pine Creek . Connor kept the field fifteen years, and afterward put it out as security against certain sums  Naboth has put a fence about the best of the field, but neither the Indians nor the shepherds can quite forego it . It is a low-lying field, between the mesa and the town, with no hillocks in it, but a gentle swale where the waste water of the creek the clematis slips down season by season to within a hundred yards of the village street . It comes upon one with a flame-burst as of revelation; little hard red buds on leafless twigs, swelling unnoticeably, then one soft fiery glow, whispering with bees as  Naboth's field is maturing red-hooded linnets for their devouring . All the purlieus of bigelovia and artemisia are noisy with them for a month . The most one sees of the burrowers, gophers, and mice is the fresh earth The mesa trail begins in the campoodie at the corner of Naboth's field . It strikes diagonally across the foot of the hill-slope from the field until it reaches the larkspur level . A foot-pace carries one too slowly past the units in a decorative scheme . There is always a lupin wash somewhere on the mesa trail, where the hummocks of Lupinus ornatus run a delicate gamut from silvery green of spring to silvery white of winter foliage . The rumor of tumult grows and dies in passing, as the red fox and the coyote are free of the night hours, and both killers for the pure love of slaughter . The badger is a pot-hunter and no sportsman, but not so much of a curmudgeon . There are always solitary hawks sailing above the mes Campoodies of the Paiutes are spots of desolation long after the wattles of the huts have warped in the brush heaps . The Paiute seeks rising ground, depending on air and sun for purification of his dwelling, and when it becomes wholly untenable, moves . A campoo There is the smell of sage that is the warning that sap is beginning to work in a soil that looks to have none of the juices of life in it . there is the kind of smell that sets one thinking what a long furrow the plough would turn up here . The smell of the bitter dust that comes up from Seyavi and the boy lay up in the caverns of the Black Rock and ate tule roots and fresh-water clams that they dug out of the slough bottoms with their toes . In the interim, while the tribes swallowed their defeat, they must have come very near In our kind of society, when a woman ceases to alter the fashion of her hair, it is safe to suppose that she has never come up against anything too big for her . Every Indian woman is an artist,--sees, feels, creates, but does not philosophize about her processes . Seyavi's Seyavi made baskets for the satisfaction of desire, and danced in the twilights, young desire crying out to young desire . In those days, when the spring was at flood and the blood pricked to the mating fever, the maids chose their flowers, wreathed themselves . Sey the Paiutes gathered into the Northern Reservation only such poor tribes as could devise no other end of their affairs . Here, all along the river, and south to Shoshone Land, live the clans who owned the earth, fallen into the deplorable condition of hangers-on . In her best days Se There is no other privacy possible in a campoodie . All the processes of life are carried on out of doors or behind the thin, twig-woven walls of the wickiup . The Indian learns to possess his countenance in impassivity, to cover his head with his blanket . There is always an amount of local history to be read in the names of mountain highways where one touches successive waves of occupation or discovery . Here you have the Spanish Californian in Cero Gordo and pinon; Symmes and Shepherd, pioneers both; Tunawai, probably Shoshone; Oak Creek, Kears The manzanita is adjusting its tortuous stems to the sharp waste of boulders . It is worth watching the year round in the purlieus of the long-leafed pines, and more bloom than you can properly appreciate . In a country of cone-bearers there is usually a good strip of a few pines are home dwellers, like the sisterhood of quaking asp . They grow in clumps by spring borders, and all their stems have a permanent curve toward the down slope . The trees are white with violets and all outdoors keeps the clock . It goes on, the play of light I have a pair of horns, inconceivably heavy, that were borne as late as a year ago by a very monarch of the flock whom death overtook at the mouth of Oak Creek after a week of wet snow . There is always more in evidence than in summer weather in the winter hills than one looks The Weeper is a mountain of Lone Pine . It sits eastward and solitary from the lordliest ranks of the Sierras . The weeper has a bowed, grave aspect as of some woman you might have known . Often the stream drops bodily from the bleak bowl of some alpine lake . Sometimes it breaks out of a hillside as a spring where the ear can trace it . It is always a favorite local tradition that one or another of the blind lakes is bottomless . The ousel haunts them No other animal of any pretensions makes a habitat of the alpine regions . It is possible to find plant life higher than the water borders; grasses perhaps the highest, gilias, royal blue trusses of polymonium, rosy plats of Sierra primroses . The color scheme runs I have pawed about for hours in the chill sward of meadows where one might properly expect to get one's death, and got no harm from it . There is no accounting for their distribution; although provident anglers have assisted nature of late, one still comes upon roaring brown waters where trou In the summer there will be hosts of rosy-winged dodecatheon, called shooting-stars .

Tik-Tok of Oz," Queen Ann Soforth of Oogaboo, a small monarchy separated from the rest of Oz's Winkie Country, sets out to raise an army to conquer Oz. Seventeen men eventually make up the Army of Oogaboo; they march out of their valley. Glinda magically rearranges the path through the mountains and Queen Ann and her army march out of Oz into a low-lying, befogged country. Betsy Bobbin, a girl who is a year older than Dorothy Gale, and her loyal mule Hank are washed ashore during a storm. They arrive at a large greenhouse that is the domain of the Rose Kingdom, where the roses tell them that no strangers are allowed. Just as the Royal Gardener (apparently the only human allowed in this flowery kingdom) is about to pass sentence on Betsy and Hank, the Shaggy Man falls through the greenhouse's roof, and charms the Gardener into sparing all of their lives with his Love Magnet. The flowers, not having hearts, are unaffected by the Magnet, and force the travellers to leave, taking with them the newly plucked Rose Princess Ozga, a cousin of Ozma, the ruler of Oz. The Shaggy Man relates how Ozma sent him here by means of the Magic Belt because he wanted to find his brother, who went digging underground in Oklahoma and disappeared. He surmised that the Nome King, ruler of the underground Nome Kingdom, captured him. They meet up with Polychrome the Rainbow's Daughter; and they rescue Tik-Tok from the well where the Nome King had tossed him. Once Tik-Tok is wound up, he accompanies Betsy, Hank, the Shaggy Man, Ozga, and Polychrome to their chance encounter with Queen Ann and her army. In a rage, Queen Ann orders them to be seized and bound, but Private Files &mdash; the only private in this army of generals, colonels, and majors &mdash; refuses to bind innocent girls. He resigns his commission on the spot. When Queen Ann learns of the riches to be found in the Nome King's underground kingdom, she calms down and accepts the services of Tik-Tok as her new private. The Nome King (who has recovered from having drunk the Water of Oblivion in The Emerald City of Oz) is aghast at this group coming toward his underground kingdom. Since no one can be killed in Oz, the Nome King seeks to discourage them, first by taking them through the Rubber Country, and then disposing of them by dropping them through the Hollow Tube, a conduit leading to the other side of the world. There the party enters the jurisdiction of the immortal called Tittiti-Hoochoo, the Great Jinjin, who vows to punish the Nome King for using the Hollow Tube. He sends Tik-Tok and the others back with his Instrument of Vengeance, a lackadaisical dragon named Quox. Quox and his riders bound from the other end of the Tube into an army of Nomes and narrowly evade them. Queen Ann and the Army of Oogaboo fall into the Slimy Cave when they enter the Nome Kingdom; the Shaggy Man and his companions are captured by the Nome King. Ann and her army escape the cave while the Nome King amuses himself by transforming his captives into various objects. Quox arrives, bursting through the main cavern. The Nome King sees the ribbon around Quox's neck and forgets all the magic he ever knew. The Nome King is driven out of his kingdom when Quox releases six eggs from the padlock around his neck. The eggs, poisonous to Nomes, follow the Nome King to the Earth's surface and confine him there. The new Nome King, the former chief steward Kaliko, vows to help the Shaggy Man find his brother, who he knows is in the Metal Forest. The Shaggy Man meets his brother in the center of the Forest; but the brother was cursed with a charm of ugliness by the former Nome King. A kiss will break a charm. First Betsy, a mortal maid, tries to undo the spell; then Ozga, a mortal maid who was once a fairy, tries. Finally the fairy Polychrome's kiss restores the Shaggy Man's brother to his former self. There is a banquet of rejoicing in the Nome Kingdom, and the former Nome King earnestly pleads to be let back into the underground lair (""No Nome can really be happy except underground""), which Kaliko allows on condition that he behave himself. Once on the surface again, Polychrome ascends her rainbow and Ozma uses the magic belt to bring Tik-Tok back to Oz and send Queen Ann, the Army of Oogaboo, Files, and Ozga back to Oogaboo. The Shaggy Man only agrees to return when his brother, Betsy, and Hank are allowed to enter Oz too. Upon being welcomed in Oz, Hank, the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, and the Saw-Horse debate who is the best mistress &mdash; Betsy (for Hank), Dorothy (for the Lion and the Tiger), or Ozma (for the Saw-Horse). The three girls are listening and laugh at a silly quarrel, which the animals realize is silly too. In addition, Dorothy finally gets to hear her dog Toto speak &mdash; for all animals can in the Land of Oz.
","TIK-TOK OF OZ by L. FRANK BAUM To Louis F. Gottschalk, whose sweet and dainty melodies breathe the true spirit of fairyland, this book is affectionately dedicated to My Away up in the mountains, in a far corner of the beautiful fairyland of Oz, lies a small valley which is named Oogaboo . Ozma allowed the various parts of Oz to have their Kings and Queens and Emperors and the Ann resented the fact that her kingdom was so tiny and her people so stupid and unenterprising . When Salye refused to sweep the floor of the living room, Ann said: ""This absurd Kingdom of Oogaboo tires ""I am going to conquer the world, and I command you to join my Army,"" says Queen of Oogaboo . ""You shall be a General,"" says Jo Cone, whose name was Jo Bunn . The first man she came to Jo Nails, Jo Cake, Jo Ham and Jo Stockings were all four made Majors . The next four--Jo Sandwich, Jo Padlocks, Jo Sundae and Jo Buttons-were appointed Captains of the Army ""I hate to have a Private Soldier in my army,"" Ann says . ""Ozma's army doesn't fight,"" says Files . Files says he knew where a gun-tree grew and would pick the to conquer and to conquer is to secure plunder is to become a hero . With such noble determination to back me, the world is mine! Come, Generals; let us march"" Then the Colonels shouted to the Majors: No one had ever visited Oz, so it took them some time to discover they were not in Oz at all . ""We have started out to conquer the world, and here is part of it,"" says Ann . It was a barren country and not ""I have never seen a Rak, to be sure, but I have read of them in the story-books that grew in my orchard,"" says Private Files . ""I cannot see how that would help us,"" wailed Colonel Private Files knew from the sound of their voices that they had escaped . ""I beg you not to leave me,"" Files said to the Rak . The Rak began to roll its immense body sidewise, so as to crush the officers Queen Ann gave them a severe scolding for their cowardice, at the same time praising Files for his courage . After a brief rest they descended into a brook, on the banks of which Queen Ann  Betsy Bobbin sat up, rubbed her eyes and stared across the water . Hank saw the raft and swam to it, but he was so clumsy he never would have been  Betsy waded ashore, the mule following closely behind her . ""Hee-haw!"" replied Hank and trotted up a little pathway to the top of the bank . The Roses looked at the  ""I believe it,"" said the Moss Rose, haughtily, ""and it is devoted to the culture of the rarest and fairest Roses grown."" ""Of course not; he's a man-a wonderful man ""Why, I s'pose you couldn't help the haste,"" said Betsy . ""I'm trying to find my dear little brother,"" said Shaggy . Hank squeaked at him solemnly ""For goodness sake! What do you s'pose became of him?"" replied Shaggy . ""I see you're dying to ask me why,"" replied Betsy . ""No Ruler has condemned us yet,"" says Gardener Betsy . ""We haven't even seen the Ruler of the Rose Kingdom,"" says the Gardener . Upon these bushes grew the members of the Royal Family of the The Gardener turned away to talk with his Roses and Betsy whispered to her companion: ""Let's pick her, Shaggy."" ""If she's royal, she has the right to rule this Kingdom, and if we pick Hank the mule seized a garden fork and began jabbing it at strangers . The Rose Princess was sobbing bitterly; Hank uttered defiant ""Hee-haws"" the Shaggy Man The coming of the Rainbow is always a joyous event to earth folk . In the barren country where rain had just fallen there appeared to be no human beings at all . The Rainbow appeared, just the same, and dancing gayly upon its arch ""I don't want you!"" cried Shaggy Man in a sympathetic tone, thinking she meant ""beau"" ""I want my _Rain_bow,"" cried Polychrome . ""I love you,"" she said . Polychrome was a fairy when Ozga was driven out of her Rose Kingdom . As they continued their wandering journey, direction meant very little to them . By and by they espied a faint trail that looked like a path . ""This well seems to have been the dump for all the old rubbish in the country,"" says Shaggy Man . ""What is it?"" asked Betsy, clinging to the windlass and panting for breath . At this moment the Rainbow ""The best way is to walk,"" says Rug-ge-do, who is called in these parts the Met-al Mon-arch . ""I suspected that my brother was the prisoner of Ruggedo; but now I know it,"" said Rug ""If you keep me wound up,"" said Tik-Tok, ""I will last a thou-sand years"" ""Why, it's an army!"" commanded Shaggy . ""I'm not afraid of an army. ""I'm sorry I've conquered you,"" said Betsy indignantly . ""You must understand,"" said Ann, ""that I am the Queen of Oogaboo"" ""We won't be anybody's slaves,"" ""I've the right to resign if I want to,"" retorted the Queen . ""Indeed you haven't!"" shrieked Files, and all the officers echoed her cry . The ""I am not a traitor, Your Majesty,"" said Queen of Oogaboo . ""I can-not fight, and you must not for-get that it was Rug-ge-do who threw me in the well,"" ""Fall--in!"" yelled the Majors, drawing their swords . ""You must fall in marching order,"" asked the Clockwork Man . The Rose Princess looked more closely at the flowers . She dropped to her knee Ruggedo, the Monarch of all the Metals and Precious Stones of the Underground World, was a round little man with a flowing white beard, a red face, bright eyes and a scowl that covered all ""I'm positive, Kaliko, that mortals are this very minute on their way here to annoy me,"" said Ruggedo . ""Look through your spyglass, and see where the invaders are,"" commanded the King . The Clockwork Man saw the stream and the stepping-stones and placed his foot upon the first stone . The result was astonishing: First he sank down in the soft rubber, which then rebounded and sent Tik-Tok ""There is no rubber over here,"" Betsy remarked Files . ""Suppose you all try to bound over the stream, without touching the stepping-stones,"" she called to them . When Polychrome tried to bound across the stream The Metal Monarch walked up and down in silence, thinking deeply . ""Let the Long-Eared Hearer listen to them,"" commanded Ruggedo eagerly . The King and Kaliko grew impatient at the delay  Ruggedo's Chief Magician suddenly disappeared . The Royal Chamberlain went to his private room and began to write letters of recommendation of himself . Suddenly Hank pitched forward and began falling and Betsy tumbled over his head . The Rainbow's Daughter laughed merrily, and so infectious was this joyous laugh . ""I'd like to know where and when we'll arrive, just the same,"" said Polychrome . Queen Ann sailed up from the Tube, took a ride through the air as high as the treetops . The Peculiar Person smashed a jeweled crown over his eyes and tumbling him to the ground . After ""I can't say, exac'ly where we came from, 'cause I don't know the name of the place,"" he exclaimed . ""The way we got here was through the Hollow Tube,"" exclaimed the Pe Tubekins wore a robe of scarlet, embroidered a terrible dragon's head . He had one blue leg and one pink one, while both his feet were jet black . Before they could reach it, invisible hands raised Tik- Tubekins bowed humbly before a high throne, but there seemed to be no one in it beside themselves . Then suddenly there rang out the clear tone of a bell and at the sound all was changed . ""I'm the on-ly Pri-vate Sol-dier in the par-ty,"" said the Citizen . The Citizen rose and bowed respectfully to the Clockwork Man . Tik-Tok told ""I wonder what 'twill be,"" said Betsy, begging for mercy . The Private Citizen--otherwise known as Tititi-Hoochoo, the Great Jinjin--looked at the little girl steadi Betsy and Polychrome enjoyed resting themselves upon the downy divans . The Queen told the strangers about this beautiful land, which is one of the chief residences of fairies who minister to the needs of mankind. ""I understand about the dragon, now,"" says Polychrome, nodding her lovely head . Erma, a fairy, had many questions to ask about the various Kings and Queens who lived in this far-away, secluded place  ""Cause electric'ty is the newest light we know of,"" says Queen Betsy . Daylight cannot take place of Sunlight, which gives us strength and energy . ""I love 'em, too!"" said Bets Ruggedo is an immortal, but he is not good. His magic powers hurt mankind more than they benefit them . He had unjustly kept the Shaggy Man's brother a prisoner, but the Nome King misled them so that Queen Ann and her officers were the only ones who looked solemn and seemed to fear the return journey . ""I don't mind going back so _very_ much, 'cause the Jinjin promised to make it easy for us,"" Quox had a row of seats attached to his back, one for each member of the party . The dragon's head and face were so large that it took him a long time to wink . ""I'm glad of that,"" Quox slid his great body into the Tube and the journey to the other side of the world began . ""I think I shall take it easy and fall slower, or I'm likely to get dizzy,"" said Shaggy . The dragon ""I don't see a particle of likeness between us, I must confess,"" retorted Quox . ""You are not a live thing; you're a dummy,"" said Tik-Tok  Ruggedo, the Metal Monarch and King of the Nomes, was trying to amuse himself in his jeweled cavern . The King had thrown his sceptre at Kaliko six times, without hitting him once . It was Ruggedo glared at him wickedly, for it was impossible to turn the Tube upside down . ""About nine thousand three hundred and six miles, seventeen furlongs, eight feet and four inches,"" replied the Hearer . Rugged ""No one can hear an egg, Your Majesty,"" cried the King . ""The only way to discover the truth is to look through the Magic Spyglass,"" he said . The King had listened attentively to Kaliko . Ruggedo threw his sceptre at Kaliko's head, aiming it so well that the Royal Chamberlain had to fall flat upon the floor in order to escape it . ""I hope you won't hurt any of the ""I don't,"" said Betsy; ""And I love brimstone,"" declared the dragon . ""I wonder when we'll reach the bottom of this hole,"" said Tik-Tok, ""is be-cause the world Quox struck the ground, but most of the dragon's passengers only felt a slight jar . When they left the dragon, the seats that were strapped to the monster's back disappeared . The army of nomes had gathered thick Queen Ann chuckled softly to himself as he scratched his left ear with his hind claw . Quox shook his head. ""No,"" said Queen Ann, ""I'll wait here for you. Don't ""I do not wish to be cruel or to shed any blood,"" says Tik-Tok . Then the officers fell in line, the four Generals abreast and then the four Colonels and the four Captains . Ruggedo had ""Don't do that!"" exclaimed General Guph, earnestly, ""for it will be useless to resist and you might hurt some one"" Tik-Tok raised his gun and took aim, not knowing what damage the gun might do  The Queen leaned her back against the wall and a big flat rock swung inward . Then she jumped up and cried to the others: ""A passage! Follow me, my brave men, and we may yet escape"" Kal ""Don't let us worry,"" said Shaggy and Files . ""Do you suppose they are likely to fail?"" asked the Rose Princess . Shaggy Man's speech was overheard by the Long-Eared Hearer . ""True!"" cried the King in delight at this easy solution of the problem . ""If we can manage to bind the Shaggy Man's arms, tight to his body, he could not get the Love Magnet out of his pocket,""  ""I am Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter,"" Ruggedo said proudly . ""I wonder what is the best and surest way to waken a dragon,"" she said . The Nome King was laughing and jeering at ""I'll make a bargain with you, sweet Polly. You shall be my daughter or my aunt or grandmother--whichever you like--only stay here to brighten my gloomy kingdom and make me happy!"" ""No, thank you ""They're all gone,"" says Nome King . ""They left no address, Your Majesty; but they are not in the pit,"" roared the King, ""who took the cover off?"" ""There is no one in the Slim Ruggedo was about to do something as dreadful to the Rose Princess and Files . When Polychrome saw Shaggy Man transformed into a dove, she turned and ran from the cavern . She seized the pearl necklace Ruggedo threw his sceptre at Files and Tik-Tok . ""I don't believe you'll perform any more magic,"" said Quox in a quiet voice . Then he turned toward File Ruggedo glared at the immense head of Quox as if fascinated and there was fear in the old King's eyes as he watched his enemy's movements . Very deliberately he raised one claw, touched the catch of the great Tititi-Hoochoo was driven from his cavern in truth, driven by those dreadful eggs . When he picked himself up he saw the eggs lying in a row just before the arched opening . After the King Great Jinjin's charm was broken and the Rose Princess stood before them as sweet and smiling as ever . The dove flew straight to the dragon and alighted on the ribbon . ""I beg your pardon!"" replied Shaggy Man Betsy and Hank returned with the Royal Chamberlain to the throne cavern . They told her what had happened to Ruggedo and she told them how kind Kaliko had been to her . ""Would the no ""That reminds me to ask what has become of Queen Ann and the Officers of Oogaboo,"" said Files . ""I'm sure I can't say,"" replied Kaliko, ""Do you suppose Ruggedo destroyed them?"" ""Why Quox Quietly Quits When the chief nomes assembled before their new King they joyfully saluted him and promised to obey his commands . But when Kaliko questioned them, none knew the way to the Metal Forest, although all Ruggedo had neglected to fill his pockets with gold and jewels . he was a wanderer with wealth at his command, so he still loitered around the caverns wherein he knew so much treasure was stored . "" ""The Metal Forest does not fill all of this great cavern, by any means,"" said Betsy . ""I don't mind an honest, out-an'-out enemy, who fights square; but we won't miss it A Bashful Brother With fast beating hearts came full upon a most astonishing scene . There was Ruggedo in the hands of the officers of Oogaboo, a dozen of whom were clinging to the old nome and holding him fast ""Ruggedo is no longer Metal Monarch, or King of the nomes,"" Files told her . ""He has been deposed and cast out of his kingdom by Quox; but here is the new King, whose name is Kaliko ""He's called the Ugly One. Perhaps you'll know him by that,"" exclaimed Shaggy . ""No one else inhabits this splendid dome, so there can be no mistake,"" assented Kaliko . Shaggy Man ""I cannot leave my dear brother here, and he refuses to come out of that house and face us,"" said Shaggy . ""I'm sure it isn't big enough to hide a man's face,"" said the Ug ""I am sure I can't break the enchantment,"" says the Ugly One . ""The best food in the world,"" says Betsy . The ""Hotel Trees"" bear a certain kind of table d' The Three-Course Nuts are not all exactly alike in flavor or contents . They are all good and in each one may be found a complete three-course dinner . ""I'm pretty certain that the things we want, and can ""Help yourself, ma'am,"" said King Kaliko, and at once the officers of the Army took advantage of his royal permission . All the way along the passage they found a regular trail of jewels strewn along the rock floor  ""You ought to be ashamed of that mean trick,"" says Ruggedo . ""If I did, I've forgotten,"" he sighed, slapped his chest, rubbed his ear, and stared stupidly around ""I've never kissed a mortal man in all the thousands of years I have existed, but I'll do it to please our faithful Shaggy Man, whose unselfish affection for his ugly brother deserves to be rewarded"" ""I ""No nome can ever be happy any place but underground,"" says Shaggy Man . ""I think he's rather good looking,"" says Betsy, gazing at the man critically . Ruggedo had come trailing along after the rest ""The Rain King is my uncle, you know, and perhaps he has read my thoughts and is going to help me,"" says Shaggy . With a cry of gladness Polychrome sprang upon a point of rock and held out Ozma and the Wizard of Oz had been following the adventures of Shaggy Man and Tik-Tok in the Rose Kingdom . ""I think the poor Queen has suffered enough in her misguided effort to conquer the world,"" said the Wizard . Ozma drew from his pocket a tiny instrument against his ear . ""I have sent the people of Oogaboo back to their own little valley,"" said the Ruler of Oz . He said this with a sigh ""I'm sure it has stopped raining,"" said Shaggy . ""Let us send for Dorothy,"" said Ozma . Tik-Tok greeted her and the Wizard with the same gentle smile and simple manner . Ozma drew her to her and kissed her . ""I'm afraid Shaggy and his friends will endure many hardships before they get out of that rocky place,"" said the Wizard. ""Well, I think so,"" said Ozma: ""Perform your magic, Wizard!"" He put a silver plate upon a small standard and pouring upon the plate . ""You must pardon these disagreeable fumes,"" the Wizard says . The Sawhorse ""You must admit it is more sociable than to bray your dreadful 'hee-haw',"" said the Sawhorse . ""I am the only horse, of any description, in this favored Land,"" ""You foolish beasts!"" exclaimed the Ruler of Oz, in a gentle but chiding tone of voice . ""I have the right to express my opinion, your Highness,"" pleaded the Lion . Hank has proved his faith Dorothy knelts down before him and shakes her finger above his nose .

Further Adventures of Lad," ;""The Coming of Lad"" A couple, referred to only as the Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window with a bag of loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog. ;""The Fetish"" While in town with the Mistress, Lad saves her from an attack by a sick dog being chased by the police and other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, ordering the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him. ;""No Trespassing!"" Two young couples trespass on the Place's lake shore, only to be driven off by the Master and Lad. A week later, Lad is taken to compete in a dog show in Beauville. One of the men from the lake is there to show his boss' champion Lochaber King. He plots to dye Lad's coat red to embarrass the Master for the earlier incident, but accidentally dyes Lochaber King's coat instead, after the two dogs change locations. He is left having to answer for the dog's ruined coat while Lad wins the silver trophy. ;""Hero-Stuff"" The Master and Mistress buy a female collie puppy named Lady to be Lad's companion and mate. Lad becomes her protector and slave, as she bullies him from his food and the best places to lie, and endures the flashes of nasty temper that lead her to bite his ears and paws. As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in a shed for the night as punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats. ;""The Stowaway"" When Lady returns from a fifteen-week hospital stay, she abandons Lad to play with their son Wolf, whom she no longer recognizes. The moping Lad takes to hiding in the car to beg for a ride, and accidentally becomes a stowaway when the Master and Mistress go to the Catskills to visit friends. As dogs are not allowed in the residential park where they are staying, they take Lad to a kennel, but he quickly escapes and returns to the park. While waiting for the Master and Mistress to wake up, he follows a strange scent through a neighbor's house, leading to his being blamed for destroying a room in that house. However, it's quickly discovered that the vandal was another neighbor's pet monkey, hidden by its owner who did not like the park's new ""no pet"" rules. When Lad returns home, Lady effusively greets her returned mate. ;""The Tracker"" Cyril, an eleven-year-old with a nasty penchant for making trouble, comes to stay at the Place for three months. While there, he frequently lies, sneakily torments Lad, and plays such horrible pranks on the staff that two quit. After he is caught kicking Lad in plain sight, the Master loses his temper and scolds him. Cyril goes into a rage and runs away in a snowstorm. He gets lost and falls off a high cliff, landing on a small ledge. Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives. ;""The Juggernaut"" Lad's mate Lady is run over and killed by a speeding driver who deliberately aimed his car at her. Lad and his owners both saw the crime, but were unable to catch up to the driver in time. Lad grieves terribly until they go to a local tennis tournament where he finds Lady's killer. He attacks the man to kill him, but the Master calls him off. The Mistress explains to the shocked crowd what the man had done, then takes a cured Lad home. They later learn that the crowd destroyed the man's expensive car and he was expelled from the club for killing Lady. ;""In Strange Company"" The Master and Mistress take Lad on their annual fall camping trip to the mountains for two weeks. During the trip, Lad playfully teases a bear, leading to a fight, which the master ends by scaring off the bear. At the end of the trip, Lad is accidentally left tied to a tree at the camp site. While his owners are returning to find their missing dog, Lad is trapped by a forest fire. When the bear he fought earlier rushes past with singed fur, Lad chews through his rope and follows the other animals of the forest to sit in a nearby lake. When his owners arrive, he runs through the burning fire to join them, blistering his paws on some coals. ;""Old Dog; New Tricks"" After 12-year-old Lad is praised for bringing the Mistress a lace parasol that he found on the road, he begins searching the road for more things to find, sometimes stealing them unintentionally from people who were nearby but not watching their items. As he had gotten more sensitive in his older age, his owners always praised him for the gifts, which ranged from a full picnic basket to roadkill. One night, he ""finds"" a baby, who was kidnapped from a wealthy household by a disgruntled former employee and his kin. The baby had been set in the grass by his two kidnappers while they changed a flat tire. The kidnappers eventually catch up to Lad, who is carrying the child home. He fights off the men when they attack him, eventually chasing them back to their car, and they escape. The baby is returned to his parents and the kidnappers arrested, but Lad is hurt that his present results in no praise, just a lot of activity around the house. ;""The Intruders"" A large, cranky sow escapes from its herd and attacks the Mistress after she tries to shoo it out of her garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his old age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily drive her off. While fleeing, the pig runs directly into the path of one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from joining them at the end, but he quickly forgives her. ;""The Guard"" At 16, the aging Lad befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father works at the Place. Her father forces her to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats her if she is slow. The Master and the Place's superintendent try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage to stand up to her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.

He employed this ruse now, in a spurt of fear- Laddie snatched a bullet through his bag and ran at top speed .

The Mistress saw a hundred faces all turned in one direction, Laddie, a grand collie, stepped forward to investigate . He thrust out a gloved hand in frightened rebuff . The Mistress and Lad, as ever, came home from town to greet the returning man . The Master checked himself, sniffing the sodden October air, and Lad was the adoring slave of Lady. He watched over her, in her increasingly active rambles about the Place . At such times, he proved Lady grew lank and leggy in the patches between sodden snow-swathes . Lady was emerging from clownish puppyhood into the charm Lad was one of the rare dogs to whom a single command or prohibition was enough to fix a lesson in his uncannily wise brain for life .  Lady was slinking out into the hall; crestfallen and scared . The Master brought her back to the scene of her mischief . Lady writh The Master was minded to spare Lady from any future punishment by making this present lesson sink deep into her brain . As Lady was locked in by mistake, he was  Lad followed the Mistress and the Master to the tool-house and into the dining room . As a rule, he was all around them and in front and Lad was awake, but he knew the voice for Lady's . The smoke-smell, by itself, meant nothing whatsoever to Lad .

Lad had done the work Laddie was thrown more and more on the society of the Mistress and the Master . In a bare second or two, Lad would trot slowly Wolf and Lady followed the car from the garage to the door; and set forth at a hand-gallop for the woods . At dawning, the dew Lad had not the remotest notion he was a stowaway . On the few times when it had not been convenient to take him on drives thief slammed himself as regarded the second . The negro jerked his hand out of the tonneau far faster ""LADDIE! What in the world--?"" gasped the Mistress . ""If he hadn't been there, we'd be looking now for ""You needn't be afraid of Lad's doing any of those fool things,"" mused the Master . ""I see. H'm!""  Lad's nose drooped earthward; and he sniffed with all his might . It took him less than half that time to reach Lad scampered up to the Mistress and the Master, arriving upon the veranda . The Master recognized him from many pictures in newspapers and magazines . Rutherford Garretse sat at the foot of the steps, while he fought for breath and coherent speech . ""That--that- ""I consented to stay on at Daylight Park, only on solemn assurance of the Governors"" ""I detest animals. Particularly dogs. And now Lad was a gray monkey, small, infinitely aged and withered of aspect . His paws and forearms were black with half-dry in ""Come on, Laddie!"" whispered the Mistress, under cover of multiple talk . A week later, the car turned in again at the gates of Cyril, a three-month collie pup, was a pest, an unspeakable pest . As homesickness and novelty wore off, Cy Cyril and the Mistress were keenly aware of conditions . They labored over Lad, to make him leave Lad alone .

But the scent of Cyril was not too dim for Cyril had not had the remotest intent of laboring through the bitter cold and the snow to the house of any neighbor; there to tell his woeful tale Cyril had been traveling in an erratic half-circle, in pitch darkness, and with no visible landmarks, it is not easy to double back on one Cyril had followed the fence for a full mile, AWAY from the road, and gradually upward until he had come the line of hazels on the lip Lad halted and began to retrace his way toward the ledge .

The flame kissed them in its fast-crawling advance Lad knew nothing of this; nor why the advance of the fire's direct line had been checked . From out a screen of hazel and witch-el Lad, one eye ever on his foe, saw the onrush; he redoubled his efforts to bite through the rope, before the bear should be upon The Red Terror was enforcing a truce among the forest-folk . Lad scarce saw or noted any of his companions  The Mistress and the Master were able to guide their rattlingly protesting car up the trail from the main road .

Cat and Mouse," The book begins with Gary Soneji breaking into Alex Cross' home in Washington DC and contemplating the murders of Cross and his family. In London the killer dubbed Mr. Smith by the press is conducting a live autopsy. Mr. Smith explains to his victim what he will be feeling and that he envies his victim. At union station, Soneji opens fire on the crowd with a rifle. Cross and Sampson receive a call from Soneji letting him know where he is. Cross was expecting Kyle Craig, who had faxed Cross a letter asking for help with the Mr. Smith case. When Sampson and Cross get there, four people have already been killed. Cross and Sampson find the rifle and discover that it had been set up on a timer to randomly shoot downward. Soneji was actually on a train headed to New York City. Soneji is at Penn Station in New York City. There, he stabs a man in the back with a big hunting knife he used to kill Roger Graham in Along Came a Spider. Soneji then escapes in a subway. Cross is driving by the school and stops when he sees his girlfriend Christine’s car. When she gets home, they go for a walk, and Christine confesses that she worries about him getting hurt or killed in the line of duty. The two begin to kiss passionately, but are interrupted by Cross' pager. Cross has been called by an NYPD detective, Manning Goldman, who is investigating the Penn Station murder. Goldman is sure that Soneji behind it. Once in New York City, Cross meets with Goldman at Penn Station. A total of three people have been stabbed with a knife laced with poison. The next day Cross takes his cat, Rosie, to Quantico to be examined by the FBI. Cross is afraid that Soneji did something to the cat before giving her to him. He also meets with Kyle, who wants Cross involved in the Mr. Smith case but Alex refuses. Cross agrees to see Agent Thomas Pierce, whose own girlfriend was one of Mr. Smith's victims. Afterwards, Alex checks on Rosie, who had nothing wrong with her. In London, Mr. Smith calls the police a few blocks down telling them where to find Inspector Drew Cabot's body. Thomas Pierce is in London. He works on the Mr. Smith case almost exclusively. He’s trying to figure out the message Mr. Smith is trying to send. Sampson and Cross are in Wilmington, Delaware. They are going to visit Soneji’s wife and daughter. Cross smells decay and sees flies. They find the decapitated body of a Labrador Retriever. They discover that Soneji had decapitated his wife, but spared their daughter. Later, Cross goes to Lorton prison, where Soneji had been kept during Along Came a Spider. Cross was there to meet with a prisoner named Jamal Autry who told Cross that Soneji was raped in prison and contracted AIDS. Cross now understands that Soneji is planning one final rampage before he dies. In New York City, Soneji quietly breaks into Manning Goldman’s house at night, and hits him over the head with a lead pipe. Kyle Craig lends Alex use of the FBI helicopter to make his way to NYC. Cross meets with Goldman’s partner. They make their way to Goldman’s home in Riverdale. In the bedroom there is blood everywhere. The blood was splattered on the bed, the walls, and the floor. This was a brutal attack. Elsewhere in a bar, Soneji pick up a woman and goes with her to her apartment. Alex and the NYPD think Soneji is going after the man that raped him in prison, Shareef Thomas. They find Shareef in Brooklyn inside a crack house. A struggle ensues as they try to arrest Thomas, and Cross shoots and kills him. In Paris, Mr. Smith attacks and kills a young doctor who had just left his girlfriends house. At Bellevue Hospital, Soneji goes to find Thomas, who he believes is in intensive care. Soneji is dressed as a male nurse and wearing another disguise. Soneji goes into the room, only to find Cross and Detective Groza, Goldman’s partner, waiting for him in the room. Soneji is impressed, but prepared, as he throws a small Incendiary bomb at the detectives. Cross and Groza pull the bed on them to shelter themselves from the brunt of the bomb. Soneji makes his way out of the hospital and escapes in a city bus. Cross is afraid that Soneji plans on blowing up the bus. Cross thinks Soneji is trying to reach Grand Central Station, which proves to be correct, when Soneji makes his way out of the bus and runs toward it carrying a baby in his arm. Groza and Cross follow Soneji. They corner Soneji who swears that Cross will pay for everything. Soneji gets away by throwing the baby. The baby is caught but while everyone looks at the baby on the air Soneji makes a run for the tunnels. Groza and Cross pursue Soneji again. Soneji attacks Groza from behind. Alex and Soneji fight. Soneji swears that he'll go after Cross, even if he dies. Cross shoots Soneji in the jaw. The madman falls to the ground, accidentally detonating the other bomb in his pocket, burning him. A few days later, Cross returns home. He spends the entire day with his family. Kyle Craig calls Cross and again asks for help on the Mr. Smith case. Cross says no. Alex's family throws him a party. That night, an unknown assailant attacks Cross and his family, beating them and shooting him; Cross believes that it was Soneji. Agent Thomas Pierce examines the scene and wonders why the kids were left to live. He deduces they were beaten to make a statement but killing them was not the plan. Pierce concludes that Soneji is innocent of the attacks. Pierce examines the room and notices all the blood in the room. Soon he is told Cross has gone into cardiac arrest due to loss of blood. Kyle and Thomas head to St. Anthony’s Hospital. Thomas reminisces about his days in medical school and his girlfriend, Isabella, who was murdered by Mr. Smith. Traumatized, Pierce had given up medicine. Back in Paris, Inspector Rene Faulk investigates the young surgeon's disappearance. After looking and analyzing evidence at Cross's home, Pierce is sure that Soneji was not Cross' attacker. Pierce finds Cross' shield, burned and charred. Sampson and Pierce head to Princeton, New Jersey to examine the area where Soneji was raised. They went to talk with Soneji’s grandfather, Walter Murphy. They dig in the back and find human and animal bones, which had apparently been Soneji's first victims. At the hotel, Pierce gets an e mail from Mr. Smith that he took a young surgeon in Pierce’s honor. Mr. Smith has been contacting Pierce before he commits a murder and challenges Pierce to stop him. Pierce needs to go. Sampson is not happy with it. Mr. Smith named himself after Valentine Michael Smith from the book Stranger in a Strange Land. Mr. Smith does another live autopsy on Abel Sante. On the way to Paris, Pierce reviews notes and tries to determine what kind of a person Mr. Smith really is. Upon reaching Paris and checking into a hotel, Pierce reads his e mail from Mr. Smith and tells him where to find the doctor’s body. Pierce is accompanied by an Interpol agent named Sandy Greenberg. In the email, Mr. Smith tells Pierce not to trust her. Pierce recovers Dr. Sante’s body. His head had been separated from the body and the head had been cut in half. Pierce is at the Cross house. He’s examining Cross' room and is convinced that Soneji had a partner. Pierce takes Sampson with him to Princeton and to meet a childhood friend of Soneji’s, Simon Conklin. Pierce thinks he’s the one that tried to kill Cross, but Conklin has an alibi. After interviewing Conklin, Pierce is not only convinced Conklin did it, but that Soneji had been taking orders from him. Pierce breaks in to Conklin’s house. Pierce can’t find evidence that Conklin tried to kill Alex but after viewing the house is now sure Conklin is the killer. The book resumes going to Alex’s point of view. He is addressing a group of FBI agents at Quantico. It is revealed that the attack had been a hoax, orchestrated by Craig in order to manipulate Pierce, who is none other than Mr. Smith. Pierce had actually killed his girlfriend when he caught her cheating on him with another doctor. The resulting trauma created in Pierce a split personality, with the ""Mr. Smith"" becoming more and more dominant. The authorities only have circumstantial evidence. The FBI is hoping that being involved in this case will let Pierce go after Conklin and let the FBI catch him in the act. Sara Greenberg tells the agent that Pierce was spotted at all the recent murders. Agents are outside Conklin’s house. Inside, Pierce begins a live autopsy on Conklin, but first is trying to get a confession from Conklin for attacking Dr. Cross. The agents go in, but it’s too late. Conklin is dead and Mr. Smith has escaped. Before dying, Conklin had confessed to trying to kill Cross. Cross offers to go to Boston, Massachusetts to look at Pierce’s apartment. The apartment is full of pictures of Pierce’s dead girlfriend. Cross receives a voicemail from Pierce telling Cross where to find Smith’s next victim. The victim is found but all the organs were removed. Mr. Smith later kills a prostitute. Cross returns home and tries to find a connection. He writes the name of the victim in order and finds the connection. It was in the names. It spelled i-m-u-r-d-e-r-e-d-i-s-a-b-e-l-l-a-c-a-l-a-i-s. (I murdered Isabella Calais). The s in Calais had not been completed. Alex knew the last victim would be Dr. Straw, the man Isabella was having the affair with. The FBI set up another stakeout. Pierce shows up but keeps going in his car. Cross goes after Pierce and go on a high speed chase. The cars eventually go on a side road. Pierce loses Cross for a few minutes. When Cross and Sampson find Pierce’s car, Pierce is gone. Alex knows he wants to complete the puzzle. The S for Smith. Cross returns to Boston. At the apartment Smith had done a self autopsy. Alex tries to stop Pierce from killing himself and the two end up fighting. Sampson shoots Pierce, pointblank. it:Gatto & topo

On the left side there was a niggerhead in this world, the moss-covered relic of a centuries old stump . From the front, it narrowed, as if it faced the trail squarely . He cut an alder shoot about eight feet long, trimmed it, and poked it through the hole . Old Tom came stretching out into the morning sun and stalked over to investigate . After a careful inspection of the hole he settled down with his paws tucked under him to watch . At the moment, that seemed the likeliest thing to do . Old Tom had cleaned up the mice in the cellar hole, but they were still burrowing around the sills of the lean-to floor . After a while the rabbit began nibbling at some spears of grass that pushed through the wire of the cage . The next morning Ed pushed the trap with the rabbit in it through into the other world and watched . There was nothing but the slow progression of alien stars across the sky . Ed found a small hoofed animal, hardly bigger than old Tom, rearing and bucking with a broken leg in the trap . It was herbivorous and adult, from the looks of its teeth and hoofs, though it only weighed about fifteen pounds . When he killed it and opened it up, at first glance it looked reasonably familiar . Ed went back into his own world and got an ax, a saw, more ammunition, salt and a heavy sleeping robe . He cut a couple of poles, peeled them, and stuck them in the ground to mark the hole from this side . Then he looked around. He stood on the shoulder of a hill, in a game trail that ran down toward a stream below, in what seemed to be a fairly recent burn . There were charred stumps, and the Ed had been a hunter, never hunted, but was wary as an old wolf . By doing so, he missed the trap the Harn maintained at the ford for chance passers-by . On the other side of the creek, the trail ran angling off downstream and skirted a small lake hidden in the trees . Ed spat a thin stream over his shoulder at a pile of leaves a few feet away . The stinging unit was not that sensitive to tobacco, though it was sensitive enough . Ed's reflexes were not quite as fast as they had been when he was young, but they were better educated . Ed deduced a small rabbit-sized thing, smooth-skinned, muscular, many-legged, flattish, mottled to camouflage perfectly in the leaves . There was a head at one end, mostly undamaged since it had been at the end of a long muscular neck, with a pair of glazing beady eyes and a surprisingly small mouth . At middling distances or better, Ed could still see as well as ever, but close up he The Harn had been surprised and shocked by the explosive violence of the man's reaction to a routine harvesting maneuver . There was no proper digestive system at all, only a rudimentary gut, heavily laced with blood vessels, terminating at one end in the small second mouth, at the other in an even smaller anus . The thing had no insides except a good pair of lungs, stout heart, and the ridiculously inadequate gut--that was it . The Harn, of course, saw the Warden not as a man, but in its true aspect . It huddled protectively together in its nest, considering these new developments . Ed, in conference with old Tom and the bottle of Hudson's Bay, had done considerable hard thinking, pro and con . Ed sighed, measured the bottle with his eye--still better than three quarters full . He took the rabbit out of the live box and tethered it in a spot in the other world close to the hole . From the reaction yesterday, he judged the stinging units did not like tobacco juice . Ed slipped them on, took his rifle and hunting pack, and set out to follow the rabbit that had taken the rabbit . The trail showed well in the morning dew, going straight away along the hillside . From there, he could follow the trail pretty well with his glasses for a couple of hundred yards before he lost it . Ed stooped over to shine the light in, keeping as well clear of the entrance as possible . About ten feet back from the entrance was a huge, flattish, naked, scabrous bulk, pimpled with finger-sized teats . For a moment, the tangle of lesser monsters sorted themselves out and a wave of stingers came boiling out at him . Ed Brown was laying where the rabbit had been, melting down into a stinking soup of bones and gobbets of flesh . When he got to the hole, his arrangement of tin cans, traps, and tobacco juice no longer looked as secure as it had . He built a stout slab door and hung it from them . The Harn was beginning to develop a pretty strong dislike for Ed Brown . Ed's hand still partially paralyzed, but the Harn took the offensive . It was a rhythmic crashing outside the cabin . He crawled to where he could see the gate he had built to block the hole into the other world . The battering stopped abruptly, and through the chinks he saw a bulk piled against it . Ed went from one to another of the loopholes he had cut, blasting first with the shotgun as the Harn crowded around, then using the .30 as they grew more cautious . On the other hand, there was no rush about it either . The Harn had always kept from disturbing game close to the cabin . a stinger came from under a sill log and lashed at his foot . He killed it with the ax beside the door, saving a cartridge, and went on . Then he snatched open the door and trampled it to death . On the way back, he took the bug gun to the D-rings of the pack . Ed had an idea that in about a minute all hell would break loose . He swung the pack down on the uphill side of the den, wet the musette bag with a quick spray of gas, tossed it over his shoulder, jammed the free end of the hose into the den mouth and stabbed the can with his knife to vent it . Ed drew his knife, managed to get to one knee, and crouched there like an old gray rat . The stinger was dead too, three feet from his shoulder, and half a dozen more which had been making for him . A cloud of greasy, stinking smoke was rolling out of the den and nodded approvingly .

Equality," The story takes up immediately after the events of Looking Backward with the main characters from the first novel, Julian West, Doctor Leete, and his daughter Edith. West tells his nightmare of return to the 19th century to Edith, who is sympathetic. West's citizenship in the new America is recognized, and he goes to the bank to obtain his own account, or ""credit card"", from which he can draw on the annual stipend all citizens receive. He learns that Edith and her mother do not normally wear the long skirts he has seen them in (they have been wearing them so his 19th century sensibilities will not be shocked), and when Edith learns that he would not be shocked to see them dressed otherwise, immediately runs into the house and comes out dressed as a modern woman in a pants suit. Clothing varies widely, since it is made of strengthened paper, and is recycled when dirty and replaced at very small expense (shoes and dishes are made of variations on the same substance). Julian learns that women are free to compete in many of the same trades as men; the manager of the paper factory he goes to view is a woman. Edith herself is in the second year of the three year general labor period required of everyone before choosing a trade, but is on leave from that employment. The two tour a tenement house, in which no one now lives, kept as a reminder of things how used to be and a reminder not to go back to them. Julian opens his safe (a device unknown in 2000 outside museums). Dr. Leete sees his mortgages and securities not as long-obsolete claims to ownership interest in things, but rather in people and their labor. The papers are worthless except as antiquities, as most of such papers were burned at the conclusion of the economic transition, in a great blaze on the former site of the New York Stock Exchange. The gold coins in the safe are admired for their prettiness, but are also worthless. Julian learns more about the world of the year 2000. Handwriting has been virtually replaced by phonograph records, and jewelry is no longer used, since jewels are now worthless. Julian is amazed by a television-like device, called the electroscope. World communication is simplified, since everyone now speaks a universal language in addition to his native tongue. Not only are there motor cars, but also private air cars. Everyone is now vegetarian, and the thought of eating meat is looked upon with revulsion. The book concludes with an almost uninterrupted series of lectures from Dr. Leete and other characters, mostly concerning how the idyllic state West has arrived in was achieved.

We offer this: All men are created unequal. It would be a most interesting study to trace the growth in the world of the doctrine of ""equality"" eric liu: it was the fashion with the socialists of 1793 to trace the genesis of their notions back to the first Christian age . he says Christ himself taught that all men, irrespective of rank or possessions, are sinners, and in equal need of help . it's not probable that he undertook to inculcate anything more than the duty of universal sympathy between all peoples and classes as society then existed, he writes . dean obeidallah: at the bar of Christianity the poor man is the equal of the rich . he says the assertion of the dignity of man and of labor is, we imagine, the sum and substance of the equality and communism of the New Testament . in 1750 and 1753, J. J. Rousseau published his two discourses on social topics . eric liu: state of liberty is not a state of license; we cannot exceed our own rights without assailing the rights of others . he says every man is bound to preserve himself; community could not exist if transgressors weren't punished . He says he's a man of war, but he has a certain state of nature, and built upon it, he writes . the state of nature of Rousseau was a state in which inequality did not exist . He recognized, it is true, as a word of two different meanings: physical inequality, strength, health, and of intelligence and character . he accepted the doctrine that men are formed by laws, but holds that they are by nature good, he says . dean obeidallah: French socialists attempted to do duty as a dissolvent on the theory of the Contrat-Social . he says the doctrine of equality is false when it puts him who uses his chance well on the same level with him ill . it is not necessary to suppose that Thomas Jefferson meant anything inconsistent with the admitted facts of nature and of history, he writes . ""government derives its just power from conformity with the principles of justice,"" says sally kohn . ""the Declaration was framed for a highly intelligent and virtuous society,"" she says . she says the doctrine of equality in America and in France was not put into the fundamental law . despite the world-wide advertisement of the French experiment, it has taken almost a century for the dogma of equality to filter down from the speculative thinkers into a general popular acceptance . The formula is applied in contempt and ignorance of the past, and as if society were a machine to be moved by mechanical appliances, and not a living organism composed of distinct and sensitive beings . ""Excessive dependence on the state is the most prominent characteristic of modern socialism,"" professor Henry Fawcett says . ""Socialism in Germany and the United States,"" Fortnightly Review, November, 1878 . Fifty-one ignorant men have a natural right to legislate for the one hundred, as against forty-nine intelligent men . ""Communism,"" says Roscher, ""Political Economy, bk. i., ch. v. 78. ""is the logically not inconsistent exaggeration of the principle of equality"" if man's will is all-powerful, it is a self-sufficiency that shuts out God and the higher law, he says . david frum: a system of equal education, with its superficiality, creates discontent with the condition in which a majority of men must be a distaste for trades and for hand-work . he says it is alleged that secular education--and general schools open to all in a community of mixed religions must be secular--is training the rising generation to be materialists and socialists . but if philosopher inquires as to the general effect upon the national character, he must The equality of the sexes is the greatest gain to civilization since the Christian era . The movement has its excesses, and the gain has not been without loss . This development is unavoidable in a period of transition, and probably only temporary . emancipation of woman would end in dissolution of family, and render poor service to majority of women . if man and woman were placed entirely on the same level, it is to be feared that woman would soon be relegated to a condition as hard as that in which she is found among all barbarous nations . a paper by Canon George Rawlinson, of the University of Oxford, proposes a remedy for the social and political evils caused by the negro element in our population, the miscegenation of the white and black races . he says the results morally, intellectually, and physically, are not such as to make it attractive to the American people . there are negroes and nexoes in Africa . there is no lack of training or deficiency of culture will make the European a European . the two races are not moving in the same groove, with an immeasurable distance between them . sally kohn: we are attempting the regeneration of society with a misleading phrase . she says the dogma of equality is not satisfied by the usual admission that one is in favor of an equality of rights and opportunities, but is against the sweeping application of the theory made by the socialists and communists . the damage from the current exaggeration of equality in our society is that the attempt to realize it in fact can lead only to mischief and disappointment, she says .

A Passage to India," A young British schoolmistress, Adela Quested, and her elderly friend, Mrs. Moore, visit the fictional city of Chandrapore, British India. Adela is to marry Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny Heaslop, the city magistrate. Meanwhile, Dr. Aziz, a young Indian Muslim physician, is dining with two of his Indian friends and conversing about whether it is possible to be friends with an Englishman. During the meal, a summons arrives from Major Callendar, Aziz's unpleasant superior at the hospital. Aziz hastens to Callendar's bungalow as ordered, but is delayed by a flat tyre and difficulty in finding a tonga and the major has already left in a huff. Disconsolate, Aziz walks down the road toward the railway station. When he sees his favourite mosque, a rather ramshackle but beautiful structure, he enters on impulse. He sees a strange Englishwoman there, and angrily yells at her not to profane this sacred place. The woman, who turns out to be Mrs Moore, has respect for native customs (she had taken off her shoes before entering and she acknowledged that ""God is here"" in the mosque) disarms Aziz, and the two chat and part as friends. Mrs. Moore returns to the British club down the road and relates her experience at the mosque. Ronny Heaslop, her son, initially thinks she is talking about an Englishman, and becomes indignant when he learns the facts. He thinks she should have indicated by her tone that it was a ""Mohammedan"" who was in question. Adela, however, is intrigued. Because the newcomers had expressed a desire to see Indians, Mr. Turton, the city tax collector, invites numerous Indian gentlemen to a party at his house. The party turns out to be an awkward business, thanks to the Indians' timidity and the Britons' bigotry, but Adela does meet Cyril Fielding, headmaster of Chandrapore's government-run college for Indians. Fielding invites Adela and Mrs. Moore to a tea party with him and a Hindu-Brahmin professor named Narayan Godbole. On Adela's request, he extends his invitation to Dr. Aziz. At Fielding's tea party, everyone has a good time conversing about India, and Fielding and Aziz even become great friends. Aziz buoyantly promises to take Mrs. Moore and Adela to see the Marabar Caves, a distant cave complex that everyone talks about but no one seems to actually visit. Aziz's Marabar invitation was one of those casual promises that people often make and never intend to keep. Ronny Heaslop arrives and rudely breaks up the party. Aziz mistakenly believes that the women are really offended that he has not followed through on his promise and arranges the outing at great expense to himself. Fielding and Godbole were supposed to accompany the little expedition, but they miss the train. Aziz and the women begin to explore the caves. In the first cave, however, Mrs. Moore is overcome with claustrophobia, for the cave is dark and Aziz's retinue has followed her in. The press of people nearly smothers her. But worse than the claustrophobia is the echo. No matter what sound one makes, the echo is always ""Boum."" Disturbed by the echo, Mrs. Moore declines to continue exploring. So Adela and Aziz, accompanied by a single guide, a local man, climb on up the hill to the next cluster of caves. As Aziz helps Adela up the hill, she innocently asks him whether he has more than one wife. Disconcerted by the bluntness of the remark, he ducks into a cave to compose himself. When he comes out, he finds the guide sitting alone outside the caves. The guide says Adela has gone into one of the caves by herself. Aziz looks for her in vain. Deciding she is lost, he angrily punches the guide, who runs away. Aziz looks around again and discovers Adela's field-glasses (similar to binoculars) lying broken on the ground. He puts them in his pocket. Then Aziz looks down the hill and sees Adela speaking to another young Englishwoman, Miss Derek, who has arrived with Fielding in a car. Aziz runs down the hill and greets Fielding effusively, but Miss Derek and Adela have already driven off without a word of explanation. Fielding, Mrs. Moore, and Aziz return to Chandrapore on the train. Then the blow falls. At the train station, Dr. Aziz is arrested and charged with sexually assaulting Adela in a cave. She reports the alleged incident to the British authorities. The run-up to Aziz's trial for attempted sexual assault releases the racial tensions between the British and the Indians. Adela accuses Aziz only of trying to touch her. She says that he followed her into the cave and tried to grab her, and that she fended him off by swinging her field glasses at him. She remembers him grabbing the glasses and the strap breaking, which allowed her to get away. The only actual evidence the British have is the field glasses in the possession of Dr. Aziz. Despite this, the British colonists firmly believe that Aziz is guilty; at the back of all their minds is the conviction that all darker peoples lust after white women. They are stunned when Fielding proclaims his belief in Aziz's innocence. Fielding is ostracized and condemned as a blood-traitor. But the Indians, who consider the assault allegation a fraud aimed at ruining their community's reputation, welcome him. During the weeks before the trial, Mrs. Moore is unexpectedly apathetic and irritable. Her experience in the cave seems to have ruined her faith in humanity. Although she curtly professes her belief in Aziz's innocence, she does nothing to help him. Ronny, alarmed by his mother's assertion that Aziz is innocent, decides to arrange for her return by ship to England before she can testify to this effect at the trial. Mrs. Moore dies during the voyage. Her absence from India becomes a major issue at the trial, where Aziz's legal defenders assert that her testimony alone, had it been available, would have proven the accused's innocence. After an initial period of fever and weeping, Adela becomes confused as to Aziz's guilt. At the trial, she is asked point-blank whether Aziz sexually assaulted her. She asks for a moment to think before replying. She has a vision of the cave in that moment, and it turns out that Adela had, while in the cave, received a shock similar to Mrs. Moore's. The echo had disconcerted her so much that she temporarily became unhinged. She ran around the cave, fled down the hill, and finally sped off with Miss Derek. At the time, Adela mistakenly interpreted her shock as an assault by Aziz, who personifies the India that has stripped her of her psychological innocence, but he was never there. She admits that she was mistaken. The case is dismissed. (Note that in the 1913 draft of the novel EM Forster originally had Aziz guilty of the assault and found guilty in the court, but later changed this in the 1924 draft to create a more ambiguous ending). All the English are shocked and infuriated by what they view as Adela's betrayal of the white race. Ronny Heaslop breaks off their engagement. Adela stays at Fielding's house until her passage on a boat to England is arranged. After explaining to Fielding that the echo was the cause of the whole business, she departs India, never to return. Although he is free and vindicated, Aziz is angry and bitter that his friend, Fielding, would befriend Adela after she nearly ruined his life. Believing it to be the gentlemanly thing to do, Fielding convinces Aziz not to seek monetary redress from her. The two men's friendship suffers in consequence, and Fielding soon departs for England. Aziz believes that he is leaving to marry Adela for her money. Bitter at his friend's perceived betrayal, he vows never again to befriend a white person. Aziz moves to the Hindu-ruled state of Mau and begins a new life. Two years later, Fielding returns to India and to Aziz. His wife is Stella, Mrs. Moore's daughter from a second marriage. Aziz, now the Raja's chief physician, at first persists in his anger against his old friend. But in time, he comes to respect and love Fielding again. However, he does not give up his dream of a free and united India. In the novel's last sentences, he explains that he and Fielding cannot be friends, at least not until India is free of the British Raj. Even the earth and the sky seem to say, ""Not yet.""

The Plague," The text of The Plague is divided into five parts. In the town of Oran, thousands of rats, initially unnoticed by the populace, begin to die in the streets. A hysteria develops soon afterward, causing the local newspapers to report the incident. Authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats, unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague. The main character, Dr. Bernard Rieux, lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building's concierge, M. Michel, a confidante, dies from a fever. Dr. Rieux consults his colleague, Castel, about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town. They both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory, but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death. However, as more and more deaths quickly ensue, it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic. Authorities, including the Prefect, M. Othon, are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take. Official notices enacting control measures are posted, but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation. A ""special ward"" is opened at the hospital, but its 80 beds are filled within three days. As the death toll begins to rise, more desperate measures are taken. Homes are quarantined; corpses and burials are strictly supervised. A supply of plague serum finally arrives, but there is only enough to treat existing cases and the country's emergency reserves are depleted. When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared. The town is sealed off. The town gates are shut, rail travel is prohibited, and all mail service is suspended. The use of telephone lines is restricted only to ""urgent"" calls, leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town. The separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople, who begin to feel isolated and introverted, and the plague begins to affect various characters. One character, Raymond Rambert, devises a plan to escape the city to join his lover in Paris after city officials refuse his request to leave. He befriends some criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city. Another character, Father Paneloux, uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God punishing the citizens' sinful nature. His diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town, who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances. Cottard, a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide yet fearful of being arrested, becomes wealthy as a major smuggler. Meanwhile, Dr. Rieux, a vacationer Jean Tarrou, and a civil servant Joseph Grand exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital. Rambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan, but when Tarrou tells him that others in the city, including Dr. Rieux, also have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see, Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind. He then decides to join Tarrou and Dr. Rieux to help fight the epidemic. In mid-August, the situation continues to worsen. People try to escape the town, but some are shot by armed sentries. Violence and looting break out on a small scale, and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew. Funerals are conducted with more and more speed, no ceremony, and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased. The inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation; despondent, they waste away emotionally as well as physically. In September and October, the town remains at the mercy of the plague. Rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wife's condition is worsening. He also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work. Cottard, on the other hand, seems to flourish during the plague, because it gives him a sense of being connected to others, since everybody faces the same danger. Cottard and Tarrou attend a performance of Gluck's opera Orpheus and Eurydice, but the actor portraying Orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance. Rambert finally has a chance to escape, but he decides to stay, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left. Towards the end of October, Castel's new anti-plague serum is tried for the first time, but it cannot save the life of Othon's young son, who suffers greatly, as Paneloux, Rieux, and Tarrou look on in horror. Paneloux, who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague, gives a second sermon. He addresses the problem of an innocent child's suffering and says it is a test of a Christian's faith, since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything. He urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague. A few days after the sermon, Paneloux is taken ill. His symptoms do not conform to those of the plague, but the disease still proves fatal. Tarrou and Rambert visit one of the isolation camps, where they meet Othon. When Othon's period of quarantine ends, he elects to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son. Tarrou tells Rieux the story of his life, and the two men go swimming together in the sea. Grand catches the plague and instructs Rieux to burn all his papers. But Grand makes an unexpected recovery, and deaths from the plague start to decline. By late January, the plague is in full retreat, and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates. Othon, however, does not escape death from the disease. Cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic, from which he has profited by shady dealings. Two government employees approach him, and he flees. Despite the epidemic's ending, Tarrou contracts the plague and dies after an heroic struggle. Rieux's wife also dies. In February, the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities. Rambert is reunited with his wife. Rieux reveals that he is the narrator of the chronicle and that he tried to present an objective view of the events. Cottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home. He is arrested. Grand begins working on his sentence again. Rieux reflects on the epidemic and reaches the conclusion that there is more to admire than to despise in humans.

Venus in Furs," The framing story concerns a man who dreams of speaking to Venus about love while she wears furs. The unnamed narrator tells his dreams to a friend, Severin, who tells him how to break him of his fascination with cruel women by reading a manuscript, Memoirs of a Suprasensual Man. This manuscript tells of a man, Severin von Kusiemski, who is so infatuated with a woman, Wanda von Dunajew, that he asks to be her slave, and encourages her to treat him in progressively more degrading ways. At first Wanda does not understand or accede to the request, but after humouring Severin a bit she finds the advantages of the method to be interesting and enthusiastically embraces the idea, although at the same time she disdains Severin for allowing her to do so. Severin describes his feelings during these experiences as suprasensuality. Severin and Wanda travel to Florence. Along the way, Severin takes the generic Russian servant's name of ""Gregor"" and the role of Wanda's servant. In Florence, Wanda treats him brutally as a servant, and recruits a trio of African women to dominate him. The relationship arrives at a crisis when Wanda herself meets a man to whom she would like to submit, a Byronic hero known as Alexis Papadopolis. At the end of the book, Severin, humiliated by Wanda's new lover, loses the desire to submit. He says of Wanda:
","Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch was born in Lemberg, Austrian Galicia, on January 27, 1836 . He studied jurisprudence at Prague and Graz, and in 1857 became a teacher at the latter university  Sacher-Masoch has not created anything new in this. He has simply taken an ancient motive and developed it frankly and consciously, until there is nothing further to say on the subject . The theme recurs continually in the _Confessions_ of Jean Jacques Rou Sacher-Masoch’s works have held an established position in European letters for something like half a century . The author himself was made chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French Government in 1883, on the occasion of his literary jubilee . “I really can’t stand it here much longer,” she replied with a low stony voice . “I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the un-understandable” The divinity sneezed for the third time, and shrugged her Man and woman are mortal enemies, in your serene sunlit world as well as in our foggy one . In love there is union into a single being for a short time only, capable of only one thought, one sensation, one will, in order to be further disunited I found his personality not only interesting—and that is why many also regarded me a bit mad—but to a degree sympathetic . For a Galician nobleman and land-owner, and considering his age—he was hardly over thirty—he displayed surprising sobrie Venus in the despot has become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that constitute woman’s essence and her beauty . Venus in this abstract North, in this icy Christian world, has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch cold—” Severin Severin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed to dream with open eyes . The smoke of the fireplace curls and condenses into figures, small gray-bearded kokolds that mockingly point their finger at me . The days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort . You see no one, and no one sees you . The upshot of it all is that I don’t do much more than to stretch the canvas, smooth the bow, line This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in all my life . I love her passionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a woman who never respond to our love with anything but an eternally uniform, eternally calm, stony smile I was enraptured and filled with a strange fear by the cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms in her furs of dark sable . I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman who cut off his The night is cool. I feel a slight chill. The atmosphere is heavy with the odor of flowers and of the forest. It intoxicates. What solemnity! A nightingale sobs. The stars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour The divinity asks for her name, and mentions her own . She smiles roguishly, and bursts out into a loud, almost childlike laughter . ""You look at love, and especially woman,"" she began, shaking her head . I do not believe in the kind of love preached by Christianity, by the moderns . I am worse than a heretic, I am a pagan. I will live my own life as it pleases me . Wanda von Dunajew is a true dilettante, but hastily let go of them again . ""I am young, rich, and beautiful, and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and enjoyment,"" she said . “You were about to say— Venus is by no means little; in fact she impresses me tremendously . I have an opportunity to unfold all my small, very small talents . We are together every day, I and—Venus; we are together a great deal . I feel how Wanda's extraordinary, really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares about me . It isn’t any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me; it is a physical subjection, coming on slowly, but for that reason more absolutely . I “You are getting worse and worse!” she cried . She tore herself free, and fled rapidly toward the house, the while her adorable slipper remained in my hand . Wanda looked at me in the friendliest fashion, and then laughed again . “Whatever you wish,” Wanda began anew . “Wanda—I love you.” “Now we are back to the place where we started. You love me, and want to make me your wife, but I don’t want to enter into a new marriage,” Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became confused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration . “I am never angry at anything that is natural—” she replied, “but _I_ am afraid you suffer.” “But you don’ if I love such a woman, shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake of a bit of boastful strength? If I cannot obtain the one that is noble and simple, the woman who will faithfully and truly share my life, well then I don’t “I was _supersensual._ I scorned the healthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats’ milk . As a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was only an expression of an inordinate interest Countess Sobol, a distant aunt of mine, was visiting my parents . She was regarded by the family as a sort of Messalina . My behavior toward her was rude, malicious, and awkward . Wanda grew more confused each day, more fantastical, more supersensual . Every so and so often she appeared before me like a vision among my leather-bound books and dead bones, lying on a bed of roses, surrounded by cupids . You see, it is because I was betrayed, sold, by a woman who feigned the strictest principles and the highest ideals . You put an aureole on vice, provided only if it is honest . Your ideal is a daring To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on seemed to me exquisite delight, especially when it was inflicted by a beautiful woman . To me she represented a personification of nature, _Isis_, and man was her slave . I envied King Gunth “You surpass my dreams,” Wanda asked archly, when we met in the park to-day . “You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand, if you prove to be the man I am seeking,” she replied very seriously . ""You have corrupted my imagination,"" she continued, ""but I have a confession to make to you"" ""You will end by making of me a despot in miniature, a domestic Pompadour,"" she said . ""If you love me, Severin,"" she Wanda is a female Dionysius, who had the inventor of the iron ox roasted inside it . ""I am yours for good or evil, choose. The destiny that lies hidden within my breast drives me on—demoniacally—relentlessly Wanda swung the whip, and hit me twice . “I love you more than myself; I am devoted to you for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me whatever you will, whatever your caprice suggests.” “I hate all this play- ""What impudence,"" Wanda whispered to Wanda . ""Well, then whip me, or I shall go mad."" ""Haven’t I forbidden you,"" she said sternly, ""but you are so terribly in love."" ""I really believe,"" I kissed Wanda savagely, pitilessly, as if she wanted to slay me with her kisses . I was as in a delirium, and had long since lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless  ""I love you,"" Wanda interrupted vivaciously . The best woman will momentarily go down into the mire, and the worst unexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to shame those that despise her . Throughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has produced moral character . Man even when he is selfish or evil always follows _principles,_ woman never follows anything but _impulses._ Don’t ever forget that, and never feel secure with “I want to be your slave, as long as I love you,” said Wanda . “You really aren’t so far from wrong,” replied Wanda, “for only as my slave could you endure my loving others.” The freedom of enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable Wanda has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of honor and agree under oath to be her slave . With her arm around my neck she read this, unprecedented, incredible document to me . The end of each sentence she punctuates with a kiss ""I want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,"" Wanda exclaimed suddenly . ""I don’t fear anything from you that might dishonor me. Forgive me the ugly thought."" ""I shall be very cruel to you, do you understand?"" a Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade . He aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure, magnificent face, and splendid bearing . The women particularly gaped at him as though he were a wild animal, but he went his “You know I hate all play-acting and comedy. You have wished it,” she replied frightened . “I am taking things seriously now,” she said quietly and thoughtfully . ""You are mistaken, you make yourself out worse than you are; you are good Wanda said this to me with perfect composure, not angrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most . ""Now I know you, your dog-like nature, that adores where it is kicked, and the more, the more it is mal ""You are not the man for me._"" I looked at her, slowly withdrew my arm which was still about her waist; then I left the room, and she—she did not call me back . ""You forget that is no question as to whether you satisfy me Wanda, the dilettante, the donkey, the miserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips which were dry and hot with excitement . Wanda threw her arms around the beautiful cruel woman, and covered her face, arms, and breast with glowing kisse We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a comfortable light carriage . Wanda wore a sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short jacket of the same material . Over it she wore dark furs and loosened her neck cloth I haven’t had time to eat a mouthful and I can’t sleep, I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish peasants, Jewish peddlers, and common soldiers . When I mount the steps of her coupe, she is lying stretched In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated entrance . Wanda has thrown her fur-cloak about her . It is the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time . I confess, I like this; it impresses me . There is strength in this, and strength is the only thing one respects . You are still my servant; you are not yet my slave, for you have not yet signed the contract . I threw my arms about her, and her lips clung closely to mine . I had a curiously oppressive sensation .

The fair Russian is having an affair with her servant, you see, the race of Catherines isn’t extinct yet . Wanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the winter .

The Jungle," The main character in the book is a Lithuanian man called Jurgis Rudkus, an immigrant to the United States trying to make ends meet. The book begins describing the wedding feast beginning at four o'clock after the marriage in Chicago of Jurgis to a fifteen year old Lithuanian girl named Ona Lukoszaite whom he had known from his Lithuanian days. The second chapter goes back to when Jurgis and Ona were in Lithuania before they married and Jurgis's courtship of her, the death of her father, and their decision to start dating and eventually immigrate to the United States along with her stepmother Teta Elzbieta, and their extended family after hearing how their relative Jokubas Szedvilas is making money there. In the second and third chapters Jurgis and Ona settle in Chicago's infamous Packingtown district, where from the start, Jurgis takes a job at Brown's slaughterhouse. (Brown was a pseudonym for Armour and Company.) Jurgis believes when he immigrates to the United States that it will be a land of more freedom, but soon his employer's treatment of him disappoints him. Alas, they have to make compromises and concessions to survive. Due partly to illiteracy in English, they quickly make a series of bad decisions that cause them to go deep into debt and fall prey to con men. The most devastating decision comes when, in hopes of owning their own home, the family falls victim to a predatory lending scheme that exhausts all their remaining savings on the down-payment for a sub-standard slum house that (by design) they cannot possibly afford. The family is evicted and their money taken, leaving them truly devastated. The family had formerly envisioned that Jurgis alone would be able to support them in the United States, but one by one, all of them&mdash;the women, the young children, and Jurgis' sick father&mdash;have to find jobs in order to contribute to the meager family income. As the novel progresses, the jobs and means the family uses to stay alive slowly and inevitably lead to their physical and moral decay. A series of unfortunate events&mdash;accidents at work, along with a number of deaths in the family that under normal circumstances could have been prevented&mdash;leads the family further toward catastrophe. One injury results in Jurgis being fired; he later takes a job at Durham's fertilizer plant. (Durham was a pseudonym for Swift and Company.) The family's tragedies cumulate when Ona confesses to Jurgis, who is suspicious of her frequent absences from home, that her boss, Phil Connor, had raped her, and made her job dependent on her giving him sexual favors. In revenge, Jurgis later attacks Connor, leading to his arrest and imprisonment by the corrupt judge Pat Callahan, who sides with Connor against Jurgis. After his stint in jail, Jurgis returns home, only to find out that his family has been evicted. He finds his family at a relative's house; Jurgis also discovers Ona in labor with her second child. Ona dies in childbirth from blood loss at the age of eighteen. Jurgis lacked money to pay for a doctor; so Ona has to rely on the greedy and incompetent Madame Haupt, whose carelessness leads to Ona's death. Soon after their first child drowns in the muddy street, causing Jurgis to flee the city in utter despair and turn to drinking. At first the mere presence of fresh air is balm to his soul, but his brief sojourn as a hobo in rural United States shows him that there is really no escape&mdash;even farmers turn their workers away when the harvest is finished. Jurgis returns to Chicago and holds down a succession of jobs outside the meat packing industry&mdash;digging tunnels, as a political hack, and as a con-man&mdash;but injuries on the job, his past and his innate sense of personal integrity continue to haunt him, and he drifts without direction. One night, while looking for a warm and dry refuge, he wanders into a lecture being given by a charismatic Socialist orator, and finds a sense of community and purpose. Socialism and strong labor unions are the answer to the evils that he, his family and their fellow sufferers have had to endure. A fellow socialist employs him, and he resumes his support of his wife's family, although some of them are damaged beyond repair. The book ends with another socialist rally, which comes on the heels of several recent political victories. The speaker encourages his comrades to keep fighting for victories, chanting ""Chicago will be ours!""

The Magician," The story takes place in Ossining, New York. Ed Japhet is sixteen years old, and he is a bright, articulate boy. His father Terence teaches at his school. Ed's hobby is performing magic tricks, hence he is the ""magician"" of the title. One evening, Ed performs in front of the school on prom night, and aggravates school hoodlum Urek. Urek and his gang wait for Ed that night as he is about to go home with his dad and girlfriend. Urek attacks Ed and nearly kills him. Urek is eventually arrested on a charge of serious assault. At first this looks like a straightforward case. But Urek's dad happens to have a lawyer named Thomassy, who has made it his life's work to defend the low-lifes and the criminals of the area - and to get them off the hook. When Thomassy started his promising career as a lawyer he joined a firm with WASP surnames deliberately. They took him on and he became their most brilliant lawyer. However, the senior partner told him that as an Armenian he would never get promoted, at least while he was alive. Thomassy, stung, left and decided to follow a controversial path defending the most undesirable characters in society. He sends a birthday card every year to the old senior partner, as if to say, ""You still alive?"" As the story unfolds, the reader becomes uncomfortably aware of how an event can be interpreted by the law. It seems as though Ed has the advantage, he is talented, with a nice family and girlfriend, horribly attacked and nearly killed by a brute. But Thomassy manages to play the attack down: he discredits witnesses, intimidates others, and portrays Urek as acting only in self defense. Now the reader is unsure who the actual ""magician"" of the title really is. Also involved is German Jewish Psychiatrist Koch, who has taken an interest in the case. His involvement gives the reader an opportunity to see Urek in more depth, as previously he is portrayed as a mindless, violent and inarticulate monster. Nothing can excuse what he has done, but Koch offers more insight as to why he did it. The book ends on a violent note. Urek walks free from the assault charge and proceeds to attack Ed again, this time by hiding in Terence's car and leaping out at Ed. Ed, newly trained in Karate, can now defend himself against the thuggish Urek, with devastating results. Terence Japhet knows exactly whom to call. The book is written in the third person narrative style, but interspersed at intervals throughout the story are ""comments"" provided by the key characters.

He was highly talented, abundantly loquacious Aleister Crowley was a voluminous writer of verse, which he published sumptuously at his own expense . He had been greatly influenced _The Magician_ was published in 1908, so I suppose it was written during the first six months of 1907 . I do not remember how I Otho Stuart had brought out a play which failed to please, and he could not immediately get the cast he wanted for the next play he had in Dr Porhot spoke English fluently, with scarcely a trace of foreign accent, but with an elaboration which suggested that he had Arthur Burdon had known Arthur since he was born, and missed being present at his birth only because the Khedive Ismal summoned Dr Porhot, fearing his words might offend, hastened to explain . ""I see no harm in your saying insular,"" smile Dr Porhot had read his book, recently published, on the more famous of the alchemists . Burden's face assumed an expression of Margaret Dauncey shared a flat near the Boulevard du Montparnasse with Susie Boyd . After the toil of many years it relieved her Susie was proud to think that she would hand over to Arthur Burdon a woman whose loveliness she had cultivated with a delicate care . Margaret Susie Boyd consulted Susie, whose common sense prevented her from paying much heed to romantic notions of false delicacy . She admired Arthur Susie Boyd vowed that she would not live with Margaret at all unless she let her see to the buying of her things . The fashion is always beautiful Susie remarked that he looked upon her with friendliness, but with a certain vacancy, as though too much engrossed in his Susie Boyd had learned that common sense, intelligence, good-nature, and strength of character were unimportant in comparison with a pretty face . She was so Susie Boyd, a retired horse-dealer, was the most charming restaurant in the quarter . The _Chien Noir_, where Susie Arthur sat down, and was hurriedly introduced to a lanky youth . He wore a very high collar and very long hair, Madame Rouge was the mother of Madame Rouge, the little palefaced woman sitting next to her . She is the mistress of Rouge, who does all the illustrations for Arthur looked away quickly, for, catching his eye, gave him an amorous glance . He carried on with O’Brien, whose French was perfect Oliver Haddo flung himself back in his chair as though he had been struck a blow . He was a man of great size, two or Oliver Haddo sat down with a smile as he withdrew Madame Meyer’s chair . Marie brought him the bill of fare, It was irritating to be uncertain whether he was serious . There was a mockery in that queer glance, a sardonic smile upon the mouth Susie Boyd paused for a moment to light a cigar . The man’s effrontery did not exasperate Margaret and Arthur  Oliver Haddo's story was received with astonished silence . He had never met a person of this kind before, and could not understand it  Oliver Haddo: ""When you begin to talk of magic and mysticism I confess that I am out of my depth"" ""Everyone can make game of Dr Porhot broke the silence to hear occult matters discussed with apparent gravity . But one cannot say the same of incredulity, and Oliver Haddo put his hand on the horse’s neck . The horse seemed not to suffer from actual pain, but from an extraordinary fear . It seemed  Dr Porhot shook his head slowly . ""I don’t know what there is about him that frightens me,"" she said Arthur was prevented from answering by their arrival at the Lion de Belfort . At the door of booths men importuned the passers-by to enter  Dr Porhot stepped forward and addressed the charmer, who brightened on hearing the language of his country . He held up the flap that gave access Oliver Haddo leaned forward with eager face, and his unnatural eyes were fixed on the charmer with an indescribable expression . “You need Oliver Haddo seized the snake and opened its mouth . The snake dangled from his hand, and the reptile teeth went deep into his flesh . Arthur had never troubled himself with art till his enthusiasm taught him that there was a side of life he did not realize . He walked by her side with Susie turned away to enter Dr. Porhot’s house . The narrow streets, with their array of dainty comestibles, Dr Porhot looked about his writing-table till he found a packet of cigarettes . He gravely offered one to each of his guests . Jacques Casanova relates in his memoirs that a copy of this book was seized among his effects when he was arrested in Venice for traffic in the black Moses de Leon claimed to have an autograph manuscript by Schimeon ben Jochai . But when Moses was gathered to the bosom of his father Abraham, ""I feel that he will bring us misfortune,"" cried Margaret vehemently . ""You’re all of you absurdly prejudiced Arthur narrated the event exactly as it occurred . The sorcerer threw incense and one of the paper strips into the chaf Oliver Haddo looked at him for a minute with those queer eyes of his . He wore a long grey beard, covering nearly the whole of Oliver Haddo told his story not ineffectively, but with a comic gravity that prevented one from knowing exactly how to take it . He had letters of introduction A copper brazier stood on the altar, with charcoal of alder and of laurel wood, and in front a second brazier was placed upon a tripod Oliver Haddo's father lost his power of speech shortly before he died . It disturbed his practical mind never to be certain if Haddon was serious  I am curious to know why he excites your interest, for I am sure his peculiarities make him repugnant to a person of your robust common I have heard him preach a sermon of the most blasphemous sort in the accents of the late Dean of Christ Church, which outraged and a legend grew up around him, which he fostered sedulously, and it was reported that he had secret vices which could only be whisper Oliver Haddo has had an extraordinary experience, the truth of which Burkhardt can vouch for . He went out alone one night on the trail of Oliver Haddo owed his life to his rare power of seizing opportunities . But they quarrelled at last through his over-bearing treatment In such an atmosphere it is possible to be serious without pompousness and flippant without inanity . Arthur Burdon sat down and observed with pleasure Dr Porhot had lent her his entertaining work on the old alchemists . She had read the book with delight and was eager to know more Dr Porhot shook his head as he reads out the fine passage from the preface of the _Paragranum_ . Arthur Porhot praised his wares with the vulgar glibness of a quack . He was vain and ostentat ""I prefer those which were not practical,"" said Arthur . There is an old church in the south of Bavaria where the tincture is said to be still Oliver Haddo lost his enigmatic manner, and his face assumed a strange expression . It was plain now that his words intoxicated him, and There were ten _homunculi_—James Kammerer calls them prophesying spirits—kept in strong bottles, such as are The _homunculi_ were fed every three days by the Count with a rose-coloured substance . Once a week the bottles were empt Dr Porhot got up to go. He shook hands with Susie and with Margaret . Arthur opened the door for him. The kindly scholar Oliver Haddo's eyes were fixed upon Margaret so intently that he did not see he was himself observed . The redness gave way to a Nancy Clerk It seemed to her that she had got out of Paris all it could give her . A day or two later Susie received a telegram . Margaret sprang forward to help him, but he staggered and tumbled to his knees . The man had barely escaped death, and she Margaret had never seen so much unhappiness on a man’s face . The words were so bitter, so humiliated, that the colour rose to Oliver Haddo was attracted by all that was unusual, deformed, and monstrous, by the pictures that represented the hideousness of man or that reminde Oliver Haddo gave them at once a new, esoteric import . It was tortured by all the introspection of this later day Margaret was vaguely familiar with the music to which she listened; but there was in it, under his fingers, an exotic savour that made it harmonious with all I tell you that for this art nothing is impossible. It commands the elements, and knows the language of the stars, and directs the planets in their courses . Margaret shuddered, but she did not think the man was mad . He took one more particle of that atrocious powder and put it in the bowl  It was as if there had been a devastating storm, and the country reposed after the flood of rain and the tempestuous wind and the lightning . Margaret’s gaze was riveted upon a great, ruined tree that stood in that waste place, alone, in ghastly desolation  She saw things so vile that she screamed in terror, and she heard Oliver Haddo laugh in derision by her side . She Margaret flung herself down wearily in a chair, trying to control herself . ""I can’t understand it. I waited till the train came in Margaret had hurried till her bones ached from one celebrated monument to another . At length she could control herself no longer and burst into a sudden Margaret was terrified of Oliver Haddo, but curiously had no longer the physical repulsion which hitherto had mastered all other feelings . At the bottom Oliver Haddo dwelt there as if he were apart from any habitation that might be his . There was the acrid perfume which Margaret Oliver Haddo was transformed by the power of his words till life itself seemed offered to her . It seemed to her that a comparison was drawn for her attention between Oliver Haddo had scarcely mentioned his name and yet had poisoned her mind . She reproached Arthur in her heart because he had never understood what Susie was seized with anger because Susie dared to love the man who loved her . The web in which Oliver Haddo enmeshed her was Margaret stopped as she passed him, horribly repelled yet horribly fascinated . It was as though fiends of hell were taking revenge upon her loveliness a long procession of seminarists came in from the college which is under the shadow of that great church, two by two, in black cassocks and Oliver laid his hands upon her shoulders and looked into her eyes . Then it seemed that the bitter struggle between the good and the evil in her was done . She Susie had never kissed Arthur in that way before, and the rapture was intolerable . At length Susie’s voice reminded him of Margaret had never been in better spirits . He was very proud, very pleased, and very happy . They talked of all the things they would do when they were married Chapter X Susie was filled with dismay . She knew it must be Arthur, for he was expected at midday . It was needful first to Susie realised that Margaret had taken away the trousseau bought for her marriage . She had paid for it with the money which he had generously given Arthur sat down and leaned his head on his hand, so that she should not see his face . She knew that the man she loved was suffering an ago Oliver Haddo ""Margaret was married this morning,"" said Susie, quietly . He took it from his pocket and handed it to Susie . Dr Porhot was trying with all his might to find excuses for her . It would not make her treachery so intolerable if  Arthur and Dr Porhot looked at Susie with astonishment . ""I can’t believe that Margaret could have done such a thing Arthur went back to London next day . Susie felt it impossible any longer to stay in the deserted studio . The good Dr Porhot  A good number of bills remained unpaid, but these, Susie learnt, had been settled later . It was reported that they were now in Monte Carlo Susie was astonished to see Margaret smile and nod as she passed her . She was dressed more gorgeously than Susie’s fastidious taste It was reported that horrible rites had been performed in the garden of the villa . Some asserted that the blasphemous ceremonies of the Black Susie had not been in London for some time, and as the spring advanced she looked forward to her visit as if it were to a foreign city . She He was never free from suffering, but he seemed genuinely glad to see her . He was earning a good deal of money, and his professional reputation was making Susie had never beheld so plainly the torment of a soul in pain . She shook hands with him and jumped into a  Arbuthnot, an eye-specialist, was a colleague of Arthur’s at St Luke’s . He had taken Susie out to lunche Oliver Haddo, his heavy face wreathed with smiles, stepped forward heartily . He was able to put the beautiful actress on one side of Oliver Haddo had an amusing anecdote handy, but it was so funnily narrated that everyone roared  Susie had gone to the dressing-room to get her cloak . She stood at the door when Margaret came out . He bowed and did not Susie said she hoped I’d suffer all the agony that I’ve made you suffer . She flung herself on her knees by Arthur Margaret’s agitation was terrible to behold. It pleased him a thousand times more to devise this torture for you and me . Arthur sought to calm Arthur looked away in embarrassment, but scarcely knew how to answer . He made a vague gesture of denial . ""For God’s Margaret looked at him with staring eyes and threw back her head . ""You must be mad. You see that the room is empty,"" she said . Arthur was seized with a devouring lust for the gutter . He used to drink opium in foetid dens, and he Oliver Haddo arranged for her release from his work in London . It made Susie vaguely uneasy that there was no sign of his existence . He My Dear Arthur: I don’t know what to make of Margaret, and I wish you would come down and see her . The good-humour which I have I am seized with preposterous terrors . I wake up at night, my heart beating furiously, with the consciousness that something quite awful has happened Susie gave Arthur Burdon the note which she had found in Margaret’s room . He read it and then thought for a long time . She could not Dr Porhot was sitting among his books in the quiet, low room that overlooked the Seine . He remembered the cloud-laden sky of the country where ""I have discovered an MS. at the library of the Arsenal this morning that no one knew anything about,"" Susie said . ""What is the matter with you?"" Arthur Burdon, the ancient _bonne_, opened the door to let a visitor come in . The words were hardly spoken when Matilde opened the Arthur Burdon had thrown himself into the work which for so long had been his only solace . But as the time passed he was seized on a Haddo had quarrelled with the surrounding gentry; and she never came out of the park gates . It was useless to go to the park Arthur’s heart sank as he walked on. He had never seen a country so desolate . At the end of a long avenue “Margaret, don’t you know me?” “What do you want?” she answered placidly . “I’ve had hallucin if your life is in danger, come away for God’s sake. After all, you’re free. He can’t stop you.” “I should have Dr Porhot said: “We can’t leave her in the hands of a raving madman.” He turned on a sudden deathly I think my common sense was deserting me, and I was on the point of believing in the farrago of nonsense which they call magic . After all, Arthur hurried them to the door and told the cabman to drive to the station as quickly as ever he could . For three or four days there had “What did she die of?” asked Susie, her eyes on Arthur . “I’m going to see this doctor. Margaret’s heart was as sound as Dr Porhot prayed that one day he might hold the man’s neck between them, and see his face turn livid and purple as Arthur was silent for a moment, but his foolishness was as great as his obstinacy . It was clear that several motives would induce him to put Susie and Dr Porhot walked out; and Arthur followed on their heels . Dr Richardson slammed the street-door angri A man came to the door and rang a bell, and as soon as he opened it, Arthur pushed in . The man tried to push Arthur away Arthur looked slowly from Arthur to Dr Porhot to Susie . ""Why did you not let me know that she was ill?"" Arthur asked . Arthur gave Susie a long look. He seemed to consider her words deliberately . ""Perhaps there are means to decide that conclusively,"" he replied Arthur's hands pressed him down in the chair from which he sought to rise . His fingers were clenched on the old man’s shoulders so Susie came forward and laid her hand on his arm . ""If she died a natural death we shall have no power over her, but if her death was Dr Porhot sat in the little parlour, trying by a great mental effort to bring back to his memory all that he had read Arthur stopped them, and he pointed in front of him . They walked through the tangled bracken, among closely planted trees . There was an awful Susie was growing desperately frightened and stretched out her hand so that she might touch Arthur . But, inexplicably, a sudden terror seized Arthur stood immobile as a rock. The flames died away, and they saw one another only by the glow of the ashes, dimly, like persons in Susie’s heart stood still. They heard the sound of a woman weeping . Arthur was moody. He had lost his balance so completely that she The grimness of his answer, though it only confirmed her vague suspicions, startled her . ""If I can do nothing else, I shall shoot him like  Dr Porhot seemed bound to his chair, but no sound came from her throat . He clenched his teeth and tightened his straining muscles Arthur forgot everything. He thought of Margaret’s anguish and of her fiendish torture . He loosened his grasp and slipped one hand over the Dr Porhot and Susie followed him, side by side, and they had to haveten their steps in order not to be left behind . They  Dr Porhot and Susie went in and flashed the light of his torch all round them . They stood in a large hall, the floor Arthur walked round each room carefully, looking for a door that might lead to a staircase . They came to the staircase once more and had discovered nothing . Dr Porhot caught sight of a thermometer and was astounded at the temperature it indicated . On broad tables were test-tubes, basin Arthur touched the thing with one finger and it shrank slightly . He turned it over, and it remained in the position in which he had placed it . There were four furnaces here, and they were all alight . In order to give out more heat and to burn slowly, the fronts of them were open It was a creature of nightmare, with four arms and four legs . It crawled along the bottom of the great receptacle in which it was Oliver Haddo died of suffocation, whispered Dr Porhot .

Robur the Conqueror," The story begins with strange lights and sounds, including blaring trumpet music, reported in the skies all over the world. The events are capped by the mysterious appearance of black flags with gold suns atop tall historic landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty in New York, the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. These events are all the work of the mysterious Robur (the specific epithet for English Oak, Quercus robur, and figuratively taken to mean ""strength""), a brilliant inventor who intrudes on a meeting of a flight-enthusiast's club called the Weldon Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Members of the Weldon Institute are all firm believers that mankind shall master the skies using “lighter than air” craft, and that ""heavier than air"" craft such as airplanes and helicopters would be unfeasible. The institute has been constructing a giant dirigible called the Go-ahead, and are having a heated discussion of where to place its propeller (in front to pull it, or behind to push it) when Robur appears at the meeting and is admitted to speak to them. He chastises the group for being balloon-boosters when ""heavier than air"" flying apparatuses are the future. When asked if Robur himself has ""made conquest of the air,"" he states that he has, leading to him accepting the title ""Robur the Conqueror."" During his short time at the Weldon Institute Robur so incites the members, that they chase him outside. Just as they are about to attack him, Robur appears to vanish into the mob, but he has actually been borne away by a flying machine. Later that night Robur kidnaps the Weldon Institute's secretary, president, and the president’s valet. He takes them on board his ship, a huge rotorcraft vessel called the Albatross which has many vertical propellers so as to operate similar to a helicopter, and horizontal propellers to provide lateral movement. It bears the same black flag with golden sun that has been sighted on so many landmarks, and the music in the sky is explained to be one of the crewmen playing a trumpet. To demonstrate the vessel's superiority, Robur takes his captives around the world in the course of three weeks. The president and secretary are angry at Robur for kidnapping them and unwilling to admit that the Albatross is a fantastic vessel, or that their notions of ""lighter than air"" superiority are wrong. They demand that Robur release them, but he is aloof and always says that they shall remain as long as he desires it. Fearing they will be held captive forever, the two formulate plans to both escape and destroy the Albatross. After the horizontal propellers are damaged in a storm, the Albatross is anchored over the Chatham Islands for repairs. While the crew is busy at work, the two Weldon Institute members light a fuse and make their escape. They try to bring the valet with them but cannot find him, only later discovering that the coward had escaped already without them. The Albatross explodes and its wreckage, along with Robur and his crew, plunge into the ocean. Meanwhile the three escapees are safe on a small but inhabited island and are later rescued by a ship, then make a long journey back to Philadelphia. The Weldon Institute members return, and rather than describe their adventures or admit that Robur had created a flying machine greater than their expectations of the Go-ahead, they simply conclude the argument the group was having during their last meeting. Rather than have only one propeller to their dirigible, they decide to have one propeller in front and another behind similar to Robur's design. Seven months after their return the Go-ahead is completed and making its maiden voyage with the president, secretary, and an aeronaut. The speed and maneuverability of the dirigible marvels a huge crowd, but are trivial if compared to Robur’s Albatross. Suddenly, out of the sky there appears the Albatross. It is revealed that when the Albatross exploded, enough of it was intact so that at least some of the propellers operated and slowed its descent, saving the crew. The crew used the remains of the Albatross as a raft until they were rescued by a ship. Later, Robur and the crew made it back to his secret X Island, where the original Albatross had been built. Robur has built a new Albatross and now intends to exact revenge by showing it is superior to the Weldon Institute’s Goahead. The entirety of the final scene is described from the crowd's point of view. The Albatross begins circling the Go-ahead; the Go-ahead drops ballast and rises to fourteen thousand feet. The Albatross follows, still a circling menace. The Go-ahead is at the mercy of the Albatross because the Albatross is both faster and more maneuverable. Finally, the Go-ahead exceeds her pressure height, where her gas bags rupture. Losing her buoyancy gas, Go-ahead drops out of the sky like a rapidly descending kite. The Albatross stays alongside of Go-ahead as she falls, signalling the pilot and passengers of Go-head to come on board the Albatross. They refuse, but then the crew of Albatross again seizes them and brings them aboard the Albatross. Having demonstrated his rule over the skies, Robur returns the three men to the ground. In a speech, Robur says that nations are not yet fit for union. He cautions the crowd that it is evolution, not revolution that they should be seeking. He leaves with the promise that he will one day return to reveal his secrets of flight.
","The American and Englishmen walked up the left bank of Niagara on their way to Goat Island, the neutral ground between the falls . It is extremely unlikely that we shall again meet with them in this story . This compromise between the national There was no balloon and there were no aeronauts . In every country of the world, there was anxiety which it was important to allay . There were no means of leaving that house for the moon or Mars, or Venus, The same respect for the truth distinguished the Bureau des Longitudes . The provinces were slightly more affirmative. Perhaps in the night of the fifth and the morning of the sixth of May there had appeared a flash of light of electrical origin the observation of the observatory of Kautokeino at Finmark and Spitzbergen was disputed . he says it was not the nature of the body observed, but the precise moment of its observation . it was because It was in vain that they tried to get rid of this trumpet as an optical illusion . The ears were no more deceived than the eyes, and something had assuredly been heard . So the observatory at Boston intervene In a week the Hamburgers at the top of St. Michael’s Tower, the Turks at the end of their cathedral, the Rouennais at the summit of their minister, the Americans on the head of the Liberty statue Uncle Prudent was a personage of consideration, and in spite of his name was well known for his audacity . The seven thousand five hundred cubic meters that pass over Niagara in a second would produce seven millions of horsepower On two boards of perfect whiteness a black line is traced . The length of each of these lines is mathematically the same, for they have been determined with as much accuracy as the base of the first triangle in a trigon Phil Evans vowed against Uncle Prudent one of those hatreds which are none the less fierce for being latent . The many experiments made during this last quarter of the nineteenth century have given considerable impetus to the question of  a dynamo-electric apparatus was bought from its inventor, a Boston chemist up to then unknown . In this struggle of the inventors after a light and powerful motor, the Americans had most nearly attained what Uncle Prudent, who ought to have given the casting vote, could not decide . The dispute might last for some time, unless the government interferes . In the United States the government meddles with private affairs as little as a kilogram of crocodile produces eight kilograms of masseteric force . a hound can only amount to one hundred . It has been deduced that the pressure of the jaw of an ordinary cro a few inventors in calm or nearly calm weather have succeeded in working an angle with the wind, or even beating to windward in a gentle breeze, they think that the steering of aerial apparatus lighter than the air is a practical matter Robur hurled a declaration of war into the camp of the balloonists . By a gesture Uncle Prudent ordered the firing to cease. “Yes.” continued Robur, “the future is for the flying machine. ""There is no progress for your aerostats, my citizen balloonists,"" said Robur . ""It is a simple idea to imitate nature, which never makes mistakes,"" said the voice of a scoffer  Robur disappeared amid a sheaf of hands that were thrown about as if caught in a storm . In each hand was one of those American institutions known as revolvers which the mere pressure of the fingers is enough to The members of the Weldon Institute had filled Walnut Street and its neighborhood with their tumult . they had been attacked in their own house, and they cried aloud for vengeance . To leave Frycollin was a South Carolina Negro, with the head of a fool and the carcass of an imbecile . He had never been a slave, not even by birth, but that made no difference Valet Frycollin, a Negro by birth, was a thorough coward . He was seized with convulsive fear, paralyzed in his limbs, with every hair he could The president and secretary of the Weldon Institute, although taken by surprise, would have resisted . In a second they were rendered speechless by a gag thrown down, pinioned and carried bodily off across Weldon Institute members were not precisely sheep as far as patience went . Uncle Prudent snatched away his bandage and gag . He was more dead than alive . No one came to visit them, or to Uncle Prudent was kidnapped by an ordinary thief . ""You are right, even if it is impossible,"" he said . It was a serious question, which would have to be answered before Phil Evans got out the best blade of his knife and set to work on the wall near the door . Uncle Prudent, in a sudden outburst of fury, began to rave and stamp on the sonorous plan Uncle Prudent sounded his repeater, which was a masterpiece from his colleague’s factory . Here Phil Evans gave vent to a long groan, which might have been taken for his last had he not followed Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans rushed out of their prison . It will be when the progress of mechanics has enabled us to solve the problem of aviation . In 1783, before the Montgolfier brothers had built their fire In 1742 the Marquis de Bacqueville designed a system of wings, tried it over the Seine, and fell and broke his arm . In 1781 Meerwein, the architect of the Prince of Baden, built Helicopters or spiralifers, machines which endeavour to reproduce natural flight of birds . Ornithopters, which are merely inclined planes like kites, but towed or driven by screws . Aero The aeroplane has the advantage over the aerostat even when it is furnished with the means of locomotion . One series could hold it suspended in the air, the other could drive it along under conditions marvelously adapted for speed and Robur had not availed himself of the vapor of water or other liquids, nor compressed air and other mechanical motion . But it was in the choice and application of his motive force that he could claim to be an inventor  Robur, his mate Tom Turner, an engineer and two assistants, two steersman and a cook—eight men all told—formed the crew of the aeronef . There were arms of the chase and Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were feeling the pangs of hunger somewhat keenly . But when Robur put them back on the ground they could resume full liberty of action . They found a well-laid table at which Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans looked out towards the western horizon . In a calm such speed would have been difficult and the rate would have sunk to that of an express . After Montreal they could distinguish the town’s Robur the Conqueror and his “Albatross” could make the tour of the globe in two hundred hours, or less than eight days . aeronef of the engineer had so much puzzled the people of Aeronauts have a problem with aviation, and Robur was unable to run any risk . In a few minutes the “Albatross” had attained the height of 8,700 feet, and extended the range of vision Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans had found two excellent berths, with clean linen, change of clothes, and traveling-cloaks and rugs . But if they didn't sleep soundly it was that they did Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were walking on the deck of the “Albatross” on the 14th of June . The chance of encountering an aerostat gliding through the air was too remote to be regarded The state of Illinois was left by its northern frontier in less than two hours and a half . They crossed the Father of Waters, the Mississippi, whose double-decked steam-boats seemed no bigger than canoe Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans had crossed the Black Mountains covered with pines and cedars . By five o’clock they had crossed Bad Lands of Nebraska, and the “Albatross” was over the appropriately named Great was the contrast between the barren tract of the Bad Lands passed over during the night and the landscape then unrolling beneath them . There were few villages, and few inhabitants, the country differing widely from the aurifer In three quarters of an hour the lake was overpassed, and a little farther on the last was seen of the geyser region . Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans watched the liquid columns which leaped up The “Albatross” continued her descent, slowing her suspensory screws and moderating her speed so as not to leave the train behind . In vain the prisoners endeavored to make themselves known to those below Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans had quite made up their minds to escape . But as they were only two, force was not to be thought of . The aeronef was sweeping along over the North Pacific . Francois Tapage was a Frenchman, and probably a Gascon . At the end of the abyss he had seen the immense ocean . Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans came out of their cabin  Tom Turner and his assistant were at their posts ready to obey the orders signaled to them . The “Albatross” dropped towards the sea, and remained, about fifty feet above it . There was no land to be The aeronef was dragged to the very surface of the water . A whirlpool was formed where the animal had disappeared . From every side the birds flew down on to the carcass, and their On the 19th, in the morning, the “Albatross” was over the strait of La Perouse between Saghalien and Northern Japan, and had reached the mouth of the great Siberian river, the In the air were a hundred kites of different forms, made of sheets of palm-leaf, and having at their upper end a sort of bow of light wood with a thin slip of bamboo beneath . In the The Celestial million, from the humblest tankader to the best-buttoned mandarin, was apocalyptical monster appearing in the sky of Buddha . At last a shell exploded More than two hundred summits have been measured, seventeen of which exceed twenty-five thousand feet . In front of the “Albatross” at a height of twenty-nine thousand feet, towered Mount Everest  Incomparable is the gorge between the major and the minor Himalayas . The aeronef was over Serinuggur, which is better known under the name of Cashmere . Uncle Prudent and The “Albatross” crossed the frontier of the kingdom of Herat, nearly seven hundred miles from Cashmere . In these much-disputed countries, the open road for the Russians to the English possessions in India, there The “Albatross” now headed for the north, and a few hours later was over a little hill at the northern angle of the Persian frontier . The vast extent of water was a sea. It was the Cas Uncle Prudent says the “Albatross” is going to cross the Caspian into Europe, either by the north into Russia or by the west into the southern countries . It may happen during the night that the „Albat The Caspian Sea is a volcanic depression . Without the evaporation which relieves it of its overflow, this basin would flood the low marshy ground to its north and east . It contains an immense number of Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans tried to prevent this performance . They were thrust aside . ""I will have my revenge on you and yours."" Robur motioned them away . The “Albatross” had passed over the northern shore of the Caspian . It was at this speed, the greatest that could be given to her . To jump from an express going sixty miles an hour is to risk your The “Albatross” bore with her perfectly breathable atmosphere . It was with irresistible power that they screwed themselves through the air . The last town that had been noticed was Astrakhan, situated at The “Albatross” landed in Tellermarken, Norway, at full speed . But it was over the famous fall of the Rjukanfos in Norway . Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans agreed upon Uncle Prudent folded up the note, shut it in the box, bound it round with a piece of worsted so as to keep it from opening it as it fell . And then all that had to be done was to wait The “Albatross” glided gently over the mighty city . She hovered over the highest monuments as if she was going to knock the ball off the Pantheon or the cross off the Invalides It may be interesting to know what had happened to the famous snuff-box after its fall? It had fallen in the Rue de Rivoli, opposite No. 200, when the street was deserted . In the morning On the 30th of July there was seen from the aeronef the little village of Geryville, founded like Laghouat on the frontier of the desert to facilitate the future conquest of Kabylia . Timbuktu is an important city of from twelve to thirteen thousand inhabitants, formerly illustrious in science and art . It is a long ribbon of iron destined to bind together Algiers and Timb Robur rushed into his cabin after being tempted to put his threat into execution . He was seriously tempted by the threat, and, fearful perhaps of yielding to it, rushed to his cabin . For forty-e In the morning of the 11th the “Albatross” crossed the mountains of northern Guinea, between the Sudan and the gulf . On the horizon was the confused outline of the Kong mountains in the kingdom of Dahomey The “Albatross” arrived over the plain and began to descend among the clouds which still hid her from the Dahomians . At eleven o’clock in the morning the capital was sighted, surrounded by its walls In one corner of the plain, under a guard of soldiers, were grouped the prisoners destined to accompany the defunct king into the other world . At the obsequies of Ghozo, the father of Robur and his colleagues were stricken with fear at the turn things had taken . In this way was the festival interfered with, and in this way did Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans recognize the power of the aer The “Albatross” drove along above the Atlantic, and in the morning when the sun rose there was nothing to be seen but the circular line where earth met sky . On the 13th of July she crossed the line, and the Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans were hurled back at the risk of flying overboard . They were thrown to the ends of the deck by centrifugal force . Robur had been in extreme danger for ten minutes Ex-minister of the Argentine Republic, sometimes an ex-President of the United States, sometimes a Viceroy of the Indies . Sometimes he had been ruined by making the aeronef, and had the “Albatross” resumed her course to the south, crossing the Beagle Channel, and Navarin Island and Wollaston Island, on the shores of the Pacific . After passing Lomas Bay, leaving Robur left Dahomey, she passed the last islands of the Magellanic archipelago . The 24th of July in the southern hemisphere corresponds to the 24th January in the northern . There was Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans looked in the direction pointed out by the mate . When the “Albatross” reached the confines of the Antarctic Sea the lower regions of the Pacific are covered with icefields and  The “Albatross” had arrived above them, and slowly descended . At ten o’clock at night the land was sighted—or rather they could see the lights which indicated its position . They had good reason a cyclone is a very rare occurrence in these latitudes . The crests of the waves were swept off as they rose and blown into white dust on the surface of the sea . It was manifest Robur was not the man to give in; the attraction of the cyclone was irresistible . Tom Turner was at the helm, and it required all his skill to keep her straight . In the first hours of the At the pole the night lengthened into one of a hundred and seventy-nine days . Everything showed that the “Albatross” was about to plunge into an abyss . It seemed as though The Southern Cross, whose four bright stars were gleaming overhead, illuminated the darkness . The phenomenon was one of incomparable magnificence, and the light showed the face of the country as a confused mass of Balleny Island was sighted on the coast of Discovery Land, though it could not be recognized owing to its being bound to the mainland by a cement of ice . At two o’clock in the morning, Ballen a cable one hundred and fifty feet long with an anchor at the end was dropped overboard . It was the first time the “Albatross” had been fastened to the earth since she left Philadelphia . At this height, Robur, a man of immense wealth, had established a shipyard in which he built his aeronef . In X Island, the “Albatross” rested when tired with her flight . Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans had a little conversation together . If the “Albatross” leaves this place tonight, the night will not pass without our having accomplished our task . It will be seen that the two colleagues were Robur and his crew were all at work forward . Uncle Prudent had all finished about 10 o’clock in the evening without having excited the least suspicion . After some conversation with Tom Turner it was decided to give the crew  Uncle Prudent and his colleague sat shut up in their cabin, exchanging but a few words, and listening to the suspensory screws . In this way the match would burn without betraying itself by its smoke Uncle Prudent was in search of a refuge in some distant part of the island . The Negro had had the same idea as his master and the audacity to start without telling him . At the same instant an order The “Albatross” drifted off from Pitt Island and rose obliquely to nearly three thousand feet . It was necessary to increase the ascensional power to prevent her falling into the sea . When if a passing ship had sighted the aerial machine as she sunk through the air, the aeronef drifted off more rapidly . After several experiments, he found it better to keep his ship well up Tom Turner came up to the engineer. It was a quarter past one . ""It seems to me, sir, that the breeze is falling, and going round to the west"" ""If it is raining it makes no difference a fearful explosion shook the “Albatross” . The cabins flew into splinters. The lamps went out. The electric current suddenly failed . At the same instant the hull of the  The next day there was no news of the valet Frycollin . It was possible that a band of scoundrels had attacked the colleagues here in the deserted park in the middle of the night  a telegram arrived from France at 11-37 A.M. on July 13 . It was the text of a document found at Paris in the snuff-box . The aeronef was gifted Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans and Frycollin were kidnapped in Philadelphia . The telegram from Paris had been addressed to members of the Weldon Institute . In less than an hour all America heard It is a mystery how Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans emerged alive from the thousands who welcomed them . It was expected that the colleagues would take their places at the desk . But for some reason or other both were silent, that is Uncle Prudent, Phil Evans, and Frycollin embarked for Auckland . They said nothing of their adventures, and in two weeks landed in New Zealand . The survivors of the “Albatross”  The “Go-Ahead” was built by the Weldon Institute, to take possession of her natural element . The celebrated Harry W.

But hydrogen possesses an ascensional force The “Go-Ahead” was about one hundred and fifty feet above the clearing, and was held by a rope . At twenty-five minutes past eleven the second gun was fired . Uncle Prudent and Phil Evans stood upright The “Go-Ahead” rose vertically, and the porpoise became a gudgeon . But the air was so free from mist that she remained clearly visible . The aerostat maneuvered The “Albatross” left X Island in the first week of April . Here was a chance for inflicting on their foes a terrible vengeance, which in the “Go-Ahead The “Albatross” followed her round and round at top speed . She threw away the ballast she had in reserve; she made a new leap of three thousand feet . This time it was a fall, Robur is the science of the future. Perhaps the science that will come!

Kim," Kim (Kimball O'Hara) is the orphaned son of an Irish soldier and a poor white mother who have both died in poverty. Living a vagabond existence in India under British rule in the late 19th century, Kim earns his living by begging and running small errands on the streets of Lahore. He occasionally works for Mahbub Ali, a Pashtun horse trader who is one of the native operatives of the British secret service. Kim is so immersed in the local culture, few realise he is a white child, though he carries a packet of documents from his father entrusted to him by an Indian woman who cared for him. Kim befriends an aged Tibetan Lama who is on a quest to free himself from the Wheel of Things by finding the legendary 'River of the Arrow'. Kim becomes his chela, or disciple, and accompanies him on his journey. On the way, Kim incidentally learns about parts of the Great Game and is recruited by Mahbub Ali to carry a message to the head of British intelligence in Umballa. Kim's trip with the lama along the Grand Trunk Road is the first great adventure in the novel. By chance, Kim's father's regimental chaplain identifies Kim by his Masonic certificate, which he wears around his neck, and Kim is forcibly separated from the lama. The lama insists that Kim should comply with the chaplain's plan because he believes it is in Kim's best interests, and the boy is sent to a top English school in Lucknow. The lama funds Kim's education. Throughout his years at school, Kim remains in contact with the holy man he has come to love. Kim also retains contact with his secret service connections and is trained in espionage (to be a surveyor) while on vacation from school by Lurgan Sahib, at his jewellery shop in Simla. As part of his training, Kim looks at a tray full of mixed objects and notes which have been added or taken away, a pastime still called Kim's Game, also called the Jewel Game. After three years of schooling, Kim is given a government appointment so that he can begin his role in the Great Game. Before this appointment begins however, he is granted time to take a much-deserved break. Kim rejoins the lama and at the behest of Kim's superior, Hurree Chunder Mookherjee, they make a trip to the Himalayas. Here the espionage and spiritual threads of the story collide, with the lama unwittingly falling into conflict with Russian intelligence agents. Kim obtains maps, papers, and other important items from the Russians working to undermine British control of the region. Mookherjee befriends the Russians under cover, acting as a guide and ensures that they do not recover the lost items. Kim, aided by some porters and villagers, helps to rescue the lama. The lama realizes that he has gone astray. His search for the 'River of the Arrow' should be taking place in the plains, not in the mountains, and he orders the porters to take them back. Here Kim and the lama are nursed back to health after their arduous journey. Kim delivers the Russian documents to Hurree, and a concerned Mahbub Ali comes to check on Kim. The lama finds his river and achieves Enlightenment. The reader is left to decide whether Kim will henceforth follow the prideful road of the Great Game, the spiritual way of Tibetan Buddhism, or a combination of the two. Kim himself has this to say: ""I am not a Sahib. I am thy chela.""

Memory," During a routine combat mission, Miles suffers an epileptic-like seizure, a lingering side effect of his recent death and cryo-revival. During the fit, his plasma arc is activated and he accidentally severs the legs of the courier he was sent to rescue. Terrified of the possible consequences if he lets his condition reach the ears of Simon Illyan, he falsifies the mission report to cover it up. However, Illyan has spies in place among his crew, Miles is caught out in his lies, and he is forced to resign from ImpSec. He is plunged into a state of deep depression. Meanwhile, Emperor Gregor, after years of refusing to marry any of the tall, slim, eligible Barrayaran ladies paraded in front of him by Alys Vorpatril, unexpectedly falls in love with a short, voluptuous Komarran, Laisa Toscane, a wealthy heiress and member of a Komarran economic delegation. Unfortunately, she was already in the sights of Duv Galeni, now an ImpSec commodore and friend of Miles. Being from Komarr brings Galeni under suspicion during later events. When Illyan suffers a sudden, crippling mental impairment, Miles suspects it is not natural. His attempts to investigate are blocked by ImpSec's acting chief, so he asks Gregor to assign an Imperial Auditor (a top-level troubleshooter with practically unlimited authority and answerable only to the Emperor). Gregor unexpectedly makes Miles himself a temporary Auditor. After Miles unravels the devious crime in remarkably quick time, his appointment is made permanent. Duv Galeni is cleared, becoming ImpSec's new Head of Komarran Affairs, and he discovers love in the form of Delia Koudelka.

Antony and Cleopatra," Mark Antony – one of the Triumvirs of Rome along with Octavian and Lepidus – has neglected his soldierly duties after being beguiled by Egypt's Queen, Cleopatra. He ignores Rome's domestic problems, including the fact that his third wife Fulvia rebelled against Octavian and then died. Octavian calls Antony back to Rome from Alexandria in order to help him fight against Sextus Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, three notorious pirates of the Mediterranean. At Alexandria, Cleopatra begs Antony not to go, and though he repeatedly affirms his deep passionate love for her, he eventually leaves. Back in Rome, a general brings forward the idea that Antony should marry Octavian's younger sister, Octavia, in order to cement the friendly bond between the two men. Antony's lieutenant Enobarbus, though, knows that Octavia can never satisfy him after Cleopatra. In a famous passage, he delineates Cleopatra's charms in paradoxical terms (rhetorical antithesis): ""Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale / Her infinite variety: other women cloy / The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry / Where most she satisfies."" A soothsayer warns Antony that he is sure to lose if he ever tries to fight Octavian. In Egypt, Cleopatra learns of Antony's marriage to Octavia and takes furious revenge upon the messenger that brings her the news. She grows content only when her courtiers assure her that Octavia is homely by Elizabethan standards: short, low-browed, round-faced and with bad hair. At a confrontation, the triumvirs parley with Pompey, and offer him a truce. He can retain Sicily and Sardinia, but he must help them ""rid the sea of pirates"" and send them tributes. After some hesitation Pompey accedes. They engage in a drunken celebration on Pompey's galley. Menas suggests to Pompey that he kill the three triumvirs and make himself ruler of Rome, but he refuses, finding it dishonourable. Later, Octavian and Lepidus break their truce with Pompey and war against him. This is unapproved by Antony, and he is furious. Antony returns to Alexandria, Egypt, and crowns Cleopatra and himself as rulers of Egypt and the eastern third of the Roman Empire (which was Antony's share as one of the triumvirs). He accuses Octavian of not giving him his fair share of Pompey's lands, and is angry that Lepidus, whom Octavian has imprisoned, is out of the triumvirate. Octavian agrees to the former demand, but otherwise is very displeased with what Antony has done. Antony prepares to battle Octavian. Enobarbus urges Antony to fight on land, where he has the advantage, instead of by sea, where the navy of Octavius is lighter, more mobile and better manned. Antony refuses, since Octavian has dared him to fight at sea. Cleopatra pledges her fleet to aid Antony. However, in the middle of the Battle of Actium, Cleopatra flees with her sixty ships, and Antony follows her, leaving his army to ruin. Ashamed of what he has done for the love of Cleopatra, Antony reproaches her for making him a coward, but also sets this true and deep love above all else, saying ""Give me a kiss; even this repays me."" Octavian sends a messenger to ask Cleopatra to give up Antony and come over to his side. She hesitates, and flirts with the messenger, when Antony walks in and angrily denounces her behaviour. He sends the messenger to be whipped. Eventually, he forgives Cleopatra and pledges to fight another battle for her, this time on land. On the eve of the battle, Antony's soldiers hear strange portents, which they interpret as the god Hercules abandoning his protection of Antony. Furthermore, Enobarbus, Antony's long-serving lieutenant, deserts him and goes over to Octavian's side. Rather than confiscating Enobarbus's goods, which he did not take with him when he fled to Octavian, Antony orders them to be sent to Enobarbus. Enobarbus is so overwhelmed by Antony's generosity, and so ashamed of his own disloyalty, that he dies from a broken heart. The battle goes well for Antony, until Octavian shifts it to a sea-fight. Once again, Antony loses when Cleopatra's ships break off action and flee – his own fleet surrenders, and he denounces Cleopatra: ""This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me."" He resolves to kill her for the treachery. Cleopatra decides that the only way to win back Antony's romance love is to send him word that she killed herself, dying with his name on her lips. She locks herself in her monument, and awaits Antony's return. Her plan fails: rather than rushing back in remorse to see the ""dead"" Cleopatra, Antony decides that his own life is no longer worth living. He begs one of his aides, Eros, to run him through with a sword, but Eros cannot bear to do it, and kills himself. Antony admires Eros' courage and attempts to do the same, but only succeeds in wounding himself. In great pain, he learns that Cleopatra is indeed alive. He is hoisted up to her in her monument, and dies in her arms. Octavian goes to Cleopatra, trying to persuade her to surrender. She angrily refuses, since she can imagine nothing worse than being led in triumph through the streets of Rome, proclaimed a villain for the ages. She imagines that ""the quick comedians / Extemporally will stage us, and present / Our Alexandrian revels: Antony / Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see / Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness / I' th' posture of a whore."" This speech is full of dramatic irony, because in Shakespeare's time Cleopatra really was played by a ""squeaking boy"", and Shakespeare's play does depict Antony's drunken revels. Cleopatra is betrayed and taken into custody by the Romans. She gives Octavian what she claims is a complete account of her wealth, but is betrayed by her treasurer, who claims she is holding treasure back. Octavian reassures her that he is not interested in her wealth, but Dolabella warns her that he intends to parade her at his triumph. Cleopatra resolves to kill herself, using the poison of an asp. She dies calmly and ecstatically, imagining how she will meet Antony again in the afterlife. Her serving maids, Iras and Charmian, also kill themselves. Octavian discovers the dead bodies and experiences conflicting emotions. Antony's and Cleopatra's deaths leave him free to become the first Roman Emperor, but he also feels some kind of sympathy for them: ""She shall be buried by her Antony. / No grave upon the earth shall clip in it / A pair so famous..."" He orders a public military funeral.

The Fortunes of Nigel," David Ramsay, a watchmaker, lives with his daughter Margaret on Fleet Street. He has two apprentices, Mr Vincent and Mr Tunstall. The two apprentices had run off to join in a street fray, and the goldsmith George Heriot was gossiping with Ramsay, when they brought in a fellow named Richie Moniplies with a broken head and very tattered garments. His wound having been dressed, he explained that he had come to London with his master Nigel Olifaunt to obtain payment of a debt owing to him by the king, and had been set upon as a stranger. Next morning Nigel received a visit, at his lodging with the chandler and his wife, from the goldsmith, who had known his father, and, having warned him that his estate was in danger, lent him money to appear in proper attire in Court. Heriot proceeded to Whitehall, and, having presented the young lord's petition, King James authorised him to advance part of the sum due, and promised to interest himself in his affairs. Dining with him the same day at the goldsmith's, in company with her father and Sir Mungo, Margaret lost her heart to Nigel, and employed Dame Ursula, the barber's wife, to ascertain all particulars respecting him. On being presented at Court by Lord Huntinglen he obtained an order for payment of his claim, and was introduced to the Duke of Buckingham, who announced himself as his enemy, and to the Duke's son, Lord Dalgarno, by whom he was initiated in all the vices of the aristocracy of that period, although warned by Richie, and by an anonymous letter. Meeting the Prince of Wales, later Charles I, in St. James's Park, attended by several courtiers, Nigel learnt from their manner, as well as from Sir Mungo, that he had been ill spoken of to Charles, upon which he challenged Dalgarno in the precincts of the Court, and was compelled to take refuge in Whitefriars to avoid arrest. Here he renewed his acquaintance with the barrister Lowestoffe, whom he had met at Beaujeu's tavern, and was assigned to the care of old Trapbois the lodging-house keeper and his daughter. On hearing of Nigel's trouble Margaret sought an interview with Lady Hermione, who occupied a suite of apartments in Heriot's mansion, and, having revealed her secret, was supplied with money to help him, being told at the same time by her confidant of the ill usage she had suffered from Lord Dalgarno. Vincent, who was in love with his master's daughter, and had been encouraged by Dame Ursula in extravagant habits, was now engaged by her to act as his rival's guide in effecting his escape from London. The same night old Trapbois was murdered by two ruffians who came to rob him; and, just as he had rescued the daughter, whom the bailiff Hildebrod had advised him to marry, Nigel was accosted by the apprentice, dressed as a waterman, from whom he learnt that a warrant had been issued for his apprehension, and that a boat was in readiness for him to give the king's officers the slip. Martha begged that she might accompany him, and, having secured her father's treasure, they were conducted by Vincent to the Temple Stairs. Having landed his companion at Paul's Wharf, where she was taken charge of by Moniplies, Nigel insisted on disembarking at Greenwich, instead of joining a Scotch vessel which was waiting for him at Gravesend; and having made his way to the park, he attended the king while he killed a deer, when he was recognised and consigned to the Tower. Presently Margaret, dressed as a boy, was shown into the same room; then the chandler came to claim his wife, whom he accused Nigel of having carried off; and, after he had dined, his friend Heriot arrived to reproach him with the position in which he had placed himself. He had also lost the king's warrant for his debt, and when his companion's disguise was detected, she saved him from further embarrassment by a full confession. One of her acts had been to present a petition to the king from Lady Hermione, on reading which he had commanded that Lord Dalgarno should instantly marry her; and another to offer such explanations respecting Nigel as induced his Majesty to pardon him. One hour only, however, remained within which to redeem his estates, when Moniplies appeared with the money, and Lord Dalgarno, who hoped to have secured them, was deprived of his revenge. The next day he was shot in Enfield Chase, where Captain Colepepper had planned to waylay him, as he was waiting, in company with Dame Nelly, and a page in charge of the treasure, to fight a duel with Nigel. Vincent and Lowestoffe, however, arrived in time to put two of the robbers to flight, while Moniplies killed the captain, who was suspected of having murdered Trapbois, and Christie recovered his wife. Nigel and Margaret were soon afterwards married; and as King James was honouring the feast with his presence, Richie presented Martha as his bride, who, at the same time, handed to the preserver of her life the deeds of the Glenvarloch estates, which she had freed from all liabilities, and the royal sign-manual which had been found among her father's papers.

The Answer," After the destruction of the Yeerk pool, Jake, Tobias, and Marco witness the Yeerks destroying the last remnants of their hometown and watch as the Pool ship lands amidst the destruction. After briefly considering destroying the Pool ship, the Animorphs decide that capturing the vessel would be a better strategy. Hoping to gain military assistance for the attack, Jake visits Major General Sam Doubleday. Although Doubleday is initially distrustful of Jake, he eventually listens and agrees to Jake's plan after a Controller-major on the general's staff tries to kill Jake. After a Yeerk attack on the general's base, Doubleday evacuates his troops and confines them and himself for three days to eliminate any remaining Controllers amongst his soldiers. Unfortunately, the confinement of Doubleday and his troops means a three-day delay before the Animorphs can launch their attack on the Pool ship. Sensing that the Yeerks could get the new Yeerk pool that is under construction operational within that time period, the Animorphs decide to take out the Taxxons digging the pool. In the ensuing battle, Jake finds himself underground and in the company of several Taxxons, led by none other than Arbron, a former companion of Eflangor's who became a Taxxon-nothlit several years earlier. Arbron makes Jake an offer: in exchange for allowing his followers to become nothlits and make a home for themselves on Earth, the 1709 non-Controller Taxxons on the surface and on board the Pool ship will defect and join the Animorphs in their fight against the Yeerks. Jake returns to the Hork-Bajir valley and tells the others of Arbron's offer. The brief period of excitement that reigns through the camp is spoiled, however, when Ax tells the others that the Andalites have decided that the war for Earth is lost and are planning on destroying humanity in order to stop the Yeerk menace once and for all. Ax insists that the only way to stop this is to capture the Pool ship and use its communications technology to contact the Andalite people directly, whom he does not expect to support his government's sterilization plan. The Animorphs return to Arbron and his Taxxon followers and secure their support. Jake promises the Taxxons a safe haven on Earth and the opportunity to morph anacondas. Immediately afterwords, Tom arrives and offers to assist the Animorphs in capturing the Pool ship, in exchange for the Blade ship, a hundred of his own morph-capable followers, and safe passage out of the Solar System. Sensing a trap, Jake accepts Tom's offer while simultaneously setting his own plan into motion. Jake dispatches Marco to locate Erek King and bring him to the Hork-Bajir valley, while Cassie and Ax are sent to capture Chapman. Jake manipulates Erek's pacifist programming by threatening to kill Chapman if Erek does not actively participate in the assault on the Pool ship. Erek grudgingly agrees to help. With the attack set to begin, Jake meets up with Tom and the original Animorphs, including a severely beaten Cassie, and proceeds to board the Pool ship. Once on board, Tom, as expected, betrays Jake by having a Taxxon eat Cassie and the other Animorphs, whom he believes to be hiding on Cassie in morph. Unknown to Tom, ""Cassie"" is actually a holographic projection by Erek, and the Taxxon is Tobias in morph, escorted by free Hork-Bajir led by Toby Hamee. After devouring the hologram, Tobias and Erek, with the other Animorphs in tow, are led off the bridge by Toby so they can begin trying to gain control of the Pool ship's computer systems. Visser One gives Tom command of the Blade ship so he can wipe out the Taxxon resistance. Unbeknownst to the Yeerks and the Animorphs (save for Jake), Rachel is hiding as a flea on Tom's head, with orders to kill him and prevent the Blade ship from escaping with the morphing cube, an assignment that Rachel is not expected to survive. The auxiliary Animorphs and General Doubleday's forces begin their attack on the Pool ship. Visser One lifts the ship off the ground and uses its massive weapons array to kill the auxiliary Animorphs and several of Doubleday's troops. Jake, who is still on the bridge, is forced to watch the massacre until Ax and Erek are able to gain control of the helm and force the Pool ship out of firing range. This act makes Visser One realize that the Animorphs have infiltrated the Pool ship's engineering section and orders his troops to kill everyone in the room. Jake meets up with the others, who escaped the engine room before Visser One's forces could carry out their orders, and tells them of Rachel's part in his plan. The Animorphs continue with their assault and make their way to the Pool ship's on-board Yeerk pool. Hoping to distract Visser One and Tom long enough to save Rachel's life, Jake orders Ax to flush the pool, killing 17,372 unhosted Yeerks. The Animorphs continue to the bridge, where they find a defeated and battle-weary Visser One. Jake asks the visser to fire on the Blade ship with the hope that the shots will disable it, but the Dracon beams miss and Erek drains the remaining power from the weapons. Tom hails the Pool ship to gloat about his victory, and sees Jake in tiger-morph. Enraged at the realization that the Animorphs survived his trap, Tom orders the Blade ship's weapons to be targeted at the Pool ship's bridge. Jake orders Rachel to attack... *The Animorphs make an alliance with a group of Taxxons led by Arbron. *Jake proposes to Cassie, but she opts to wait until a year after the war ends. *The auxiliary Animorphs are killed. *Rachel is sent to the Blade ship, while the rest of the original Animorphs begin their assault on the Pool ship. Marco initially tells Jake that Doubleday, a three-star general, which in the United States Army is a Lieutenant General. However, Doubleday himself later says that he is a Major General, which is a two-star rank.

The White People," A discussion between two men on the nature of evil leads one of them to reveal a mysterious Green Book he possesses. It is a young girl's diary, in which she describes in ingenuous yet evocative prose her strange impressions of the countryside in which she lives, as well as conversations with her nurse, who initiates her into a secret world of folklore and ritual magic. Throughout, she makes cryptic allusions to such topics as ""nymphs"", ""Dôls"", ""voolas,"" ""white, green, and scarlet ceremonies"", ""Aklo letters"", the ""Xu"" and ""Chian"" languages, ""Mao games"", and a game called ""Troy Town"" (the last of which is a reference to actual practices involving labyrinths or labyrinthine dances). The girl's tale gradually develops a mounting atmosphere of suspense, with suggestions of witchcraft, only to break off abruptly just at the point where a supreme revelation seems imminent. In a return to the frame story, the custodian of the diary reveals that the girl had ""poisoned herself—in time"", making the analogy of a child finding the key to a locked medicine cabinet.
","The White People Author: Frances Hodgson Burnett Release Date: March 14, 2006 [EBook #459] The WHITE PEOPLE CHAPTER I Perhaps the things which happened could only have happened to me . I do not know. I have heard other people say things--and they were not always sad people, either--which made me feel that if they knew what I know it would seem to them as though some awesome, heavy load they had always dragged about with them had fallen from their shoulders  Angus Macayre and his wife were both very young and beautiful . They came to Muircarrie as soon as they were married and lived a splendid year there together . When I was seven years old, I imagined all but very poor people lived in castles and were saluted by every one they passed . Jean Braidfute was my father's nursery governess when he wore his first kilts . She died a few minutes after I uttered my first cry . I knew how radiant and wildly in love they were . But I understood what happened to my mother one brilliant late October afternoon . I saw a change stealing over her. It was not color--it was not even a shadow of a motion . I can tell you, Ysobel. The change I saw was as if she was beginning to listen to something . In the next hour the far-off sound had drawn nearer, and it had become something else . Strangers say Muircarrie moor is the most beautiful and most desolate place in the world . From my first memory of it I had a vague, half-comforted feeling that there was some strange life on it one could not exactly see, but was always conscious of . I had only Jean and Angus, and as I found out years later, they knew what I did not, and would have put me off with explanations if I had been curious . I was listening to hear if the life on the moor made any sound I could understand . I felt as if it might, if I were very still and listened long enough . Angus and Jean were not afraid of rain and mist and change of weather . Suddenly I saw a broken and stained sword, or a dirk with only a hilt left . The man who seemed their chieftain was a lean giant who was darker but, under his darkness, paler than the rest. The big man’s hand was pressed against her breast as he held her; but it did not quite cover a dark-red stain on the embroideries of her dress . Jean and Angus were looking at me strangely, and both of them were pale . I touched my forehead where the queer scar had been . Jean swept me in her warm, shaking arms and hugged me close to her breast . It was not Jean’s words which made me sure . Angus Macayre was my tutor and taught me old Gaelic and Latin and Greek . It was a strange education for a girl, and no doubt made me more than ever unlike others . When a grand governess was sent to Muircarrie by my guardian, she abhorred the dark, frowning castle and the loneliness of the place . Jean and Angus were my closest and dearest . Jean was of good blood and a stanch gentlewoman, quite educated to be my companion as she had been my early governess . The first time I read a book he had written I caught my breath with joy . Hector MacNairn was a great and famous writer, and all the world honored him . I always felt silly when I was obliged to wear my diamonds on state occasions . Jean and I had been alone in our railway carriage for a great part of the journey . but an hour or two before we reached London a man got in and took a seat in a corner . It was only a bit of sad, everyday life which touched me . There is nothing new in seeing a poor woman in deep mourning . I felt like she might have left it behind on the platform if it hadn't clung to her skirt . When she sank into her seat she did not even lift the poor little thing into the place beside her, but left it to scramble up as best it could . It pressed close to her side, it looked up imploringly, it kissed her arm and her crape veil over and over again, and tried to attract her attention . I was taken in to dinner by a stately elderly man who tried to make me talk . I found myself looking between the flowers for a man’s face I could imagine was Hector MacNairn’s . It seemed so right that he should be the man who had understood the deeps of a poor, passing stranger woman’s woe . I could not explain why they were wonderful. I could scarcely look away, though I knew I must not be guilty of staring . Lord Armour began to talk kindly, admiring things of Mr. MacNairn and his work . I listened gratefully, and said a few words myself now and then . ""I was so absorbed in the poor mother that I am afraid I scarcely saw it,"" he said . ""It was not six years old, poor mite,"" I answered . “You don’t mean that she was not a Caucasian? Perhaps I don’’t understand,” I replied . ""I have never even seen any one dangerously ill. I--I'm as if I can’t believe it,"" he said . ""I wonder what would have happened if you had spoken to her about the child?"" ""She might not have understood,"" I murmured . “I’m afraid I’m a coward, too. She might have thought me interfering,” he replied . I had never talked to any one about it before, not even to Jean Braidfute . It was dreadful to talk so much about oneself, but he listened so . When I was a little thing I always knew he and Jean had secrets I was too young to hear . I had thought about him so much and with such adoring reverence . Sir Ian MacNairn and his wife were pleased to see that I was talking . I was a girl, and he had been my only hero; and it seemed even as if he liked me and cared about my queer life . He was not a man who had the air of making confidences or talking about himself, but before we parted I seemed to know him and his surroundings . I went to tea under the big apple-tree. It was very big and old and wonderful . No wonder Mr. MacNairn and his mother loved it . Such a tree could only have lived its life in such a garden . Mr. MacNairn came into the garden later and several other people came in to tea . She kept me near her, and in some subtle, gentle way made me a part of all that was happening . He had a handsome, aquiline face which looked very clever, but his eyes never . Mr. Le Breton was looking at a mass of white-and-purple iris at the other side of the garden . The girl, who was a lovely, fair thing, was standing quite close to him with her hand in his arm . Mr. MacNairn said in a rather startled tone, slowly, at last, “I do see what you mean--and it IS lovely. I don’t seem to know her well. She must be a new friend of my mother’s.” I was never shy when we were together. There seemed to be no such thing as shyness in the world . Mrs. MacNairn said once that she liked to touch me now and then to make sure that I was quite real and would not melt away . By The Fear they meant that mysterious horror most people feel at the thought of passing out of the world they know into the one they don’t know at all . ""Perhaps the whole mystery is as simple as this,"" said Mrs. MacNairn’s voice . “If one had seen or heard one little thing, if one’s mortal being could catch one glimpse of light in the dark,” she said . ""Nothing really IS strange,"" says Hector MacNairn . ""When we believe and know all is simple we shall not be afraid, Ysobel. Tell my mother you are not,"" he said . It was a simple, almost childish thing I told her . The Dream is what I call The Fear to myself, ‘Out on the Hillside,’ as if it were a kind of unearthly poem . But it was more real than anything I have ever felt. It was real--real! I wish that I could tell it so that you would know how real it was’ I felt almost piteous in my longing to make her know . I sank so softly--and just as my cheek almost touched the grass the dream was over! “Oh!” cried Mrs. MacNairn . “I began to sink softly down, with the heavenliest feeling of relaxation and repose, as if there existed only the soul of beautiful rest,” she said . I caught at her hand in the dark. “The words are all wrong,” I said. The greatest specialists have told us. There is some fatal flaw in his heart . At any moment, when he is talking to us, when his work is asleep, he may--cease. It will just be ceasing, at any moment. He cannot stay.” I clung to her with both arms and held her tight . I understood why they had talked about The Fear . Angus is wonderful--wonderful! He KNOWS that we ourselves are the working of the Law . From the beginning of my friendship with the MacNairns I had hoped they would stay with me at Muircarrie . When they both seemed to feel such interest in all I told them of it, I took courage . The story of Dark Malcolm and Ian Red Hand was only part of it, but it was a gruesome thing . The one human passion of dark Malcolm’s life was his love for his little daughter . They were a band of madmen in their black despair, how they tore through the black night . I sat and read until the room grew dark . When I stopped I found that Angus Macayre was standing in the dimness at the foot of the ladder . ""It was the tale of Ian Red Hand and Dark Malcolm you are reading?"" he said, slowly . Hector MacNairn is no common man. He is one who is great and wise enough to decide things plain people could not be sure of . ""You two would go to your graves hiding it if it would hurt me,"" he said, suddenly, in a queer, moved way . Wee Brown Elspeth seems very near me this evening, I said . It was the history of the feud between Ian Red Hand and Dark Malcolm of the Glen . ""I feel as if--"" I broke off and began again . “I have a puzzled feeling about her,"" Angus said. The moor had hidden itself in its softest snows of white, swathing mist . Only here and there dark fir-trees showed themselves above it, and now and then the whiteness thinned or broke and drifted . We crossed the park to a stile in a hedge where a path led at once on to the moor . Hector MacNairn said: ""We might be ghosts. We might be some of those the mist hides because they like to be hidden"" ""No. I think I am sure of that. I should feel that it was only like myself, and, if I could hear, might tell me things I want to know,"" he said . ""Only what everybody wants to know--that it is really AWAKENING free, ready for wonderful new things, finding oneself in the midst of wonders The mist had blown apart and the sun was shining on it . He stood quite still a moment and looked about him, and then he stretched out his arms as I stretched out mine . But he did it slowly, and a light came into his face . ""How he would stand and SMILE!"" he said. ""I like it more than anything else. Let us sit down, Ysobel."" Mr. MacNairn looked almost like one of the White People when I saw him last night . I wondered why he looked as he did when he took my hand and drew me down to my place on the plaid again . He bent his head and kissed it long and slowly two or three times . Hector MacNairn and Angus looked at each other in wondering question . They both stood still and watched me, and even in my excitement I saw each of them looked pale . Then they exchanged glances, as if asking each other to decide some grave thing . Angus and Jean had known all my life . They had always hidden their knowledge from me because they were afraid it might frighten me to be told . ""I have always seen what the rest of us did not see, my bairn--always"" Hector MacNairn has learned that lightning may be commanded, distance conquered, motion chained and utilized; but he has never yet begun to suspect that of all others he may be the one as yet the least explored . How do we know that there does not lie in each of us a wholly natural but, so far, dormant power of sight? Who knows when the Shadow around us may begin to clear? I saw no girl with her hand through Mr. Le Breton’s arm; Hector saw none. But she was there, smiling up at him. I wish he could have known . I was only Ysobel out on the hillside, free! This is the way it all ended . For three weeks that were like heaven we lived together at Muircarrie . The day had been more exquisite and the sunset more wonderful than before . Mrs. MacNairn was sitting by her son’s side in the bedroom whose windows looked over the moor . The next evening I stood and leaned upon the balustrade, looking out far, far and far over . I was very quiet--as quiet as the twilight’s self . Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for copies of this eBook unless you receive specific permission .

"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave"," Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass encompasses eleven chapters that recount Douglass' life as a slave and his ambition to become a free man. The story begins by telling the reader that Douglass does not know the date of his birth and that he is relatively saddened by this. He continues by explaining that his mother died when he was 7 years old. This does not affect Douglass outwardly because he was intentionally separated from his mother when he was very young, a practice which was common in slavery. It was only on the rare occasion that he would see his mother at nighttime. His father was believed to be a white man, and most people actually had the notion that Douglass was the son of his owner. At a very early age, Douglass witnesses his first brutal act of slavery when he sees Aunt Hester being whipped. The text continues and details the structure of farms, what role slaves play, and how they operate when interacting with their masters. A very important section of the Narrative is found at this point, where Douglass describes the singing of the slaves. After this, Douglass details the cruel interaction that occurs between slaves and slave holders, as well as how slaves are supposed to behave in the presence of their masters, and that even when Douglass says that fear is what kept many slaves where they were, when they tell the truth they are punished by their owners. Douglass continues by describing several events in which there has been extreme brutality against his fellow slaves. At this point in the Narrative, Douglass is moved to Baltimore, Maryland. This is rather important for him because he believes that if he had not been moved, he would have remained a slave his entire life. He even starts to have hope for a better life in the future. At this point, he discusses his new mistress, Mrs. Sophia Auld, who begins as a very kind woman but eventually turns cruel. Douglass learns the alphabet and how to spell small words from this woman, but her husband, Mr. Auld, disapproves, and states that if slaves could read, they will not be fit to be a slave, being unmanageable and sad. Upon hearing why Mr. Auld disapproves of slaves being taught how to read, Douglass realizes the importance of reading and the possibilities that this skill could help him. He takes it upon himself to learn how to read and learn all he can, but at times, this newfound skill torments him. Douglass then gains an understanding of the word abolition and develops the idea to run away to the North. He also learns how to write and how to read well. At the age of ten or eleven, Douglass' master dies and his property is left to be divided between his son and daughter. The slaves are valued alongside with the livestock, causing Douglass to develop a new hatred to slavery. He feels lucky when he is sent back to Baltimore to live with the family of Master Hugh. He is then moved through a few before he is sent to St. Michael's. He regrets not having attempted to run away, but on his voyage he makes a mental note that he traveled in the North-Easterly direction and considers this information to be of extreme importance. For some time, he lives with Master Thomas Auld who is particularly cruel, even after attending a Methodist camp. He is pleased when he eventually is lent to Mr. Covey for a year, simply because he would be fed. While under the control of Mr. Covey, Douglass is a field hand and has an especially hard time at the tasks required of him. He is harshly whipped almost on a weekly basis, apparently due to his awkwardness. He is worked and beaten to exhaustion, which finally causes him to collapse one day while working in the fields. Because of this, he is brutally beaten once more by Covey, and eventually complains to Thomas Auld, who ultimately sends him back to Covey. One day, Covey attempts to tie up Douglass, but he fights back. After a long, two hour physical battle, Douglass ultimately conquers. After this fight, he is never beaten again. He is sent to live on another plantation where he befriends other slaves and teaches them how to read. He and the others make a plan to escape, but before doing so, they are caught and Douglass is put in jail. After he is released 2 years later, he is sent to Baltimore once more, but this time to learn a trade. He becomes an apprentice in a shipyard where he is abused by several white people, when 4 whites nearly takes off his left eye. When this happens, Douglass goes to Master Hugh, who is kind regarding this situation and refuses to let Douglass return to the shipyard. Master Hugh tries to find a lawyer, but all refuse, saying they can only do something to a white person. Sophia Auld, who had turned cruel, had pitied Douglass and tended to the wound at his left eye until he is healed. At this point, Douglass is employed to be a caulker and receives wages, but is forced to give every cent to Master Auld in due time. Douglass eventually finds his own job and plans the date in which he will escape to the North. He succeeds, but Douglass does not give details of how he did so, in order to protect those who helped him and to ensure the possibility of other slaves' escape. At this point, Douglass unites with his fiancé and begins working as his own master. He ultimately attends an antislavery convention and supports the cause from that time forth.
","This electronic book is being released at this time to honor the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. . FREDERICK DOUGLASS was a stranger to nearly every member of that body . he was induced to give his attendance, on the occasion alluded to . a friend from New Bedford prevailed on Mr. DOUGLASS to address the convention . he came forward with a hesitancy and embarrassment, necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind in such a novel position . he has borne himself with gentleness and meekness, yet with true manliness of character . May he continue to “grow in grace, and in the knowledge of God” that he may be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity, whether at home or abroad _Frederick Douglass_, as a slave, was not a peculiar one; his lot was not particularly a hard one . how deplorable was his situation! how destitute of friendly counsel and aid, even in his greatest extremities! how heavy was How accursed is that system, which entombs the godlike mind of man, defaces the divine image, reduces those who by creation were crowned with glory and honor to a level with four-footed beasts, and exalts the dealer in human flesh Skeptics of this character abound in society . In some few instances, their incredulity arises from a want of reflection . but generally, it indicates a hatred of the light, a desire to shield slavery from the assaults of its foes . Such a slave's profession of Christianity is a palpable imposture . a man must be disposed to judge of emancipation by other tests than whether it has increased the produce of sugar, he says . He says if with the latter, what are you In reading your life, no one can say that we have unfairly picked out some rare specimens of cruelty . I am free to say that, in your place, I should throw the MS. into the fire . You, perhaps, may tell your story in safety, endeared as you Frederick Douglass was born in slavery as Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey near Easton in Talbot County, Maryland . In 1838 he escaped slavery and went to New York City, where he married Anna Murray, a free colored woman whom he had met in Baltimore . During the a desire of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood . I came to this, from hearing my master say, some time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old . My mother was named Harriet Bailey, the daughter of Isaac and the slaves are, in the first place, a constant offence to their mistress . the master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife . she is never better pleased than when she sees them under the if the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved, it is certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural . for thousands are ushered into the world, annually, who, like myself, owe their existence to white fathers Aunt Hester disobeyed his orders in going out, but had been found in company with Lloyd’s Ned . He then took her into the kitchen, stripped her from neck to waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back completely naked . After crossing her hands, he tied her Colonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation . They owned a large number more on neighboring farms belonging to him . Wye Town was under the overseership of a Mr. Townsend . The slaves received monthly allowance of food, eight pounds Mr. Severe was a profane swearer. It was enough to chill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to hear him talk . His presence made it both the field of blood and of blasphemy . He died very soon after I went to Colonel Lloyd was called by the slaves the _Great House Farm . It was associated in their minds with greatness . He was called the smartest and most trusty fellow, who had this honor conferred upon him most frequently . Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy . The songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart, and he is relieved by its tears . Colonel Lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated garden in Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis . colonel had to resort to stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden . if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person, it was deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden, or had tried to get in . Colonel Lloyd Colonel Lloyd kept from ten to fifteen house-servants . He was said to own a thousand slaves, and I think this estimate quite within the truth . The slaves have been known to send in spies among their slaves to ascertain their views and feelings . Colonel Lloyd’s slaves met Jacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters . He was succeeded by Mr. Austin Gore, a man possessing all those traits of character indispensable to what is called a first-rate overseer . Mr. Gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders . He was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to reach the height of his ambition . Mr. Mr. Gore was overseer upon the home plantation in St. Michael’s, Maryland . He argued that if one slave refused to be corrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy the example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the a warrant issued for her arrest, but it was never served . So she escaped not only punishment, but even the pain of being arraigned before a court for her horrid crime . I suffered much from hunger, but much more from cold . I was kept almost naked in hottest summer and coldest winter . My old master (Anthony) had determined to let me go to Baltimore . My mother was dead, my grandmother lived far off, so that I seldom saw her . I looked for home elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one which I was leaving . Cousin Tom, though not fluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire I look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd’s plantation as one of the most interesting events of my life . Going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity . I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has eric liu: she had never had a slave under her control previously to myself . he says she was in a good degree preserved from the blighting and dehumanizing effects of slavery . she says her early instruction was all out of place; her favor was In learning to read, I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly aid of my mistress . A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave on the plantation . Few are willing to incur the odium Mrs. Hamilton was beaten and cut to pieces by her cruel mistress . She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner . When she went to live with her, she was a kind and tender-hearted woman . Slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities . The first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me . She finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself . I had her rush at me with a face made I was about twelve years old, and the thought of being _a slave for life_ began to bear heavily upon my heart . Every opportunity I got, I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave . The conversation took place between them, when the slave was retake I wished myself a beast. I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own . It was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate . The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness . I was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me so . but from that time I resolved to run away . I was too young to think of doing so immediately . The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me . My old master, Captain Anthony, died, leaving only his son, Andrew, and daughter, Lucretia, to share his estate . After a long, tedious effort for years, I finally succeeded in learning how to write . I left Baltimore with a young heart overborne with sadness, a single word from the white men was enough—against all our wishes, prayers, and entreaties—to sunder forever the dearest friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings . I suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slav devoted mother of twelve children is left all alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim embers . if my poor old grandmother now lives, she lives to suffer in utter loneliness . The children, the unconscious children, who once sang and danced in In about two years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas married his second wife . Her name was Rowena Hamilton. She was the eldest daughter of Mr. William Hamilton . Master Hugh now lived in St. Michael’s . Master Thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food, he says . he was mean, and lacked the ability to conceal his meanness . Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder; he came into possession of all his slaves by marriage; and of all he was compelled to be the copyist of many, and being such, was forever the victim of inconsistency . he found himself incapable of managing his slaves either by force, fear, or fraud . his wife used to insist upon our calling him so, but to no Master Thomas was one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the very charitable purpose of taking care of them . When quite a child, she fell into the fire, and burned herself horribly . She was to master a bill of expense; as a mean man Master William Hamilton, my master’s father-in-law, always gave his slaves enough to eat . I never left there hungry, no matter how great the need of my speedy return . Mr. Covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves . My cart was upset and shattered, my oxen were entangled among the young trees . After a long spell of effort, I succeeded in getting my cart righted . I then proceeded with my team to the place where I had been chopping wood Mr. Covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his hands . He always aimed at taking us by surprise, he did by surprising us . When we were at work in the cornfield he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees . Mr. Covey's _forte_ consisted in his power to deceive . He would make a short prayer in the morning, and a long prayer at night . In this state of mind, he would start and stagger through with his hymn . O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute? I will run away. I will not stand it. Get caught, or get clear, I’ll try it . I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery . I am not the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear as much as any of them, he says . he writes that the circumstances leading to the change in Mr. Covey’s course toward me form an epoch in my humble history . I was exceedingly feeble; made so much by the kicks and blows which I received, as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had been subjected . At this moment I resolved, for the first time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask his Master Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr. Covey’s killing me, and said that he knew him . he gave me a very large dose of salts, telling me that I might remain in St. Michael’s that night, and that  I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, a slave with whom I was somewhat acquainted . I went home with him, and talked this whole matter over, and got his advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue . he said he had carried it for years; and since he Mr. Covey seemed now to think he had me, and could do what he pleased . At this moment, I resolved to fight; and, suiting my action to the resolution, I seized him hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose . My resistance Edward Covey was a first-rate overseer and negro-breaker . his reputation was at stake, and he suffered him to go unpunished . he was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master . the holidays serve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity . the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betide the slaveholder, the day he ventures to remove the mode here adopted to disgust the slave with freedom is carried out in other things . a slave loves molasses; he steals some; his master is enraged at him; but, not willing to send him off without food, gives him more than is necessary, and is It was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder, but to live in a community of such religionists . Mr. Weeden owned, among others, a woman slave, whose name I have forgotten . The peculiar feature of his government was that of whip a slave seldom dies but that his death is attributed to trickery . he was a clever soul who gave me the roots to prevent my being whipped by Mr. Covey . He devoted my Sundays to teaching these my loved fellow-slaves how to read eric liu: I had at one time over forty scholars, and those of the right sort, ardently desiring to learn . he says the work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest engagement with which I was ever blessed . I was fast approaching manhood, and year after year had passed, and I was still a slave . I decided that 1835 should not pass without witnessing an attempt, on my part, to secure my liberty . At times we were almost disposed to give up, and try to content ourselves Patrick Henry resolved upon liberty or death, and almost certain death if we failed . Henry Harris, John Harris, Henry Bailey, Charles Roberts, and myself . The plan was to get a large canoe belonging to Mr. Hamilton, and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter holidays, paddle We were not going to Baltimore; but, in going up the bay, we went toward Baltimore . As the time drew near for our departure, our anxiety became more intense . At this time, I was very active in explaining every difficulty, removing every doubt, dispelling every fear In a few moments, in rode Mr. Hamilton, with a speed betokening great excitement . He came to the door, and inquired if Master William was in . By this time, the three constables rode up, and in great haste dismounted We were not yet convicted of the intention to run away . We were to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses . When we reached St. Michael’s, we underwent a sort of examination . The evidence against us was the testimony of one person . Upon the whole, we got along very well, so far as the jail and its keeper were concerned, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland came up to Easton, and took Charles, the two Henrys, and John, out of jail, and carried them home, leaving me alone  In a few weeks after I went to Baltimore, Master Hugh hired me to Mr. William Gardner, an extensive ship-builder, on Fell’s Point . Mr. Gardner was engaged in building two large man-of-war brigs professedly for the Mexican government My fellow-apprentices soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me . They began to put on airs, and talk about the “niggers” taking the country . I succeeded very well; for I could whip the whole of them, taking them separately  Master Hugh gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed . As soon as I got a little the better of my bruises, he took me to Esquire Watson’s, on Bond Street, to see what could be lz granderson: to make a contented slave, it is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision . he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought to that only when he ceases to be a man . granderson I would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself, and thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery . a few cents, to encourage me, regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole of them . Master Thomas gave me any part of my wages; for I feared the giving me some cents would ease his conscience, and make him feel himself to be a Master Hugh refused to allow me to hire my time longer . he then refused to pay me for my week's time . The ground for his refusal was a failure on my part, one Saturday night . I thought the matter over during the next day, Sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of September, as the day upon which I would make a second attempt to secure my freedom . The wretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were perpetually before me . I was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one . I saw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause for distrust . Let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land, a land given up to be the David Ruggles is now afflicted with blindness, and is in need of the same kind offices he was once so forward in the performance of toward others . I was relieved from it by the humane hand of _Mr. David ruggles_, whose  abolitionists were able to pay their fare when we arrived at New Bedford . he says he gave me the privilege of choosing me a name, but told him he must not take from me the name of “Frederick.” I must hold on to that I assumed that northern people were exceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders . I had somehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could be no wealth, and very little refine I found many, who had not been seven years out of their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life, than the average of slaveholders in Maryland . I found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood-thirst I am told colored persons can now get employment at calking in New Bedford . The paper came, and I read it from week to week with such feelings as it would be idle for me to attempt to describe . My soul was set all on fire, such as I had never felt before . I hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land . I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds .

The Valley," Those living in the insular Nant Valley believe they are immune to the changes going on in the outside world. However, outsiders have discovered the rural idyll and are moving in to enjoy its benefits. Dafydd, the ubiquitous postman, is uncertain the Valley is ready for newcomers. The mysterious Stefan buys a derelict manor house and tries to become a squire - but finds his money impresses no-one and can't even get a drink in the pub as Gwillim the landlord hates all customers. Jane and Rob, artistic but impoverished urbanites, want to live The Good Life, but their passion for alfresco nudity has tragic repercussions for the farming community. Gradually the fabric of rural life comes undone as local and outsider collide with dramatic results...

Suddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and died . The watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the death of the ship . They saw creatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and blobs . Time was telescoped again while the man cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the woman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments . They saw the bits of tissue swell into human embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and extend themselves into babies . There was black space on the screen again, with the fingers of flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships, and then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a ""We've been so close to violent death for so long,"" says the President .

Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands . Michael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats .

The Jolly Corner," Spencer Brydon returns to New York City after more than thirty years abroad. He has agreed to have his old family house demolished in favor of a more lucrative apartment building. Before the wreckers begin, he starts to prowl the house at night. Brydon has begun to realize that he might have been an astute businessman if he hadn't forsaken moneymaking for a more leisurely life. He discusses this possibility with Alice Staverton, his woman friend who has always lived in New York. Meanwhile Brydon begins to believe that his alter ego&mdash;the ghost of the man he might have been&mdash;is haunting the ""jolly corner"", his nickname for the old family house. After a harrowing night of pursuit in the house, Brydon finally confronts the ghost, who advances on him and overpowers him with ""a rage of personality before which his own collapsed."" Brydon eventually awakens with his head pillowed on Alice Staverton's lap. It is arguable whether or not Spencer had actually become unconscious or whether he had died and has awoken in an afterlife. She had come to the house because she sensed he was in danger. She tells him that she pities the ghost of his alter ego, who has suffered and lost two fingers from his right hand. But she also embraces and accepts Brydon as he is.

The Jolly Corner Author: Henry James Release Date: May 13, 2005 . he had distinctly not, in this steadier light, come over _all_ for the monstrosities . He had come, not only in the last analysis but quite on the face of the act, under an impulse with which they had nothing to do . he was the owner of another, not quite so ""good""--the jolly corner having been superlatively extended and consecrated . Alice Staverton was a delicately frugal possessor and tenant of a small house in Irving Place, New York . she affronted, inscrutably, under stress, all the public concussions and ordeals . She was as exquisite for him as some pale pressed flower (a rarity to begin with) quaint analogy quite hauntingly remained with him, when he didn't indeed improve it by a still intense form . he was to remember these words, while the weeks elapsed, for the small silver ring they had sounded over the queerest and deepest of his own lately most disguised and most muffled vibrations . Spencer Brydon had his reasons and was growingly aware of them . Mrs. Muldoon's broomstick, in a corner, tempts the burglar . There was little to see in the great gaunt shell, but the main dispositions and the general apportionment of space . Alice Staverton had found the place, just as it stood and beyond what he could express, an interest and a joy . Mrs. Muldoon had left them, passing on to other parts, so that a whole train of declarations was precipitated by his friend's having broken out . She took him up: ""In short you're to make so good a thing of your sky-scraper that, living in luxury on _those_ ill-gotten gains, you can afford There are no reasons here _but_ of dollars . Let us therefore have none whatever--not the ghost of one,"" he says . ""Well, if it were only furnished and lived in--!"" he adds . ""For me it _is_ lived in. For me it is furnished,"" he confessed . ""I keep for ever wondering, all idiotically, as if I could possibly know! I see what it has made of me,"" says Miss Staverton . he affirmed the impotence there of any other source of interest, any other native appeal . ""I think it would have been quite splendid, quite huge and monstrous,"" Miss Staverton says . ""You'd have liked me that way?"" she asks, ""How should I not have liked you?"" ""You don't believe that,"" she says, and ""that would be enough for you"" ""I've followed strange paths and worshipped strange gods,"" she adds . ""You've the perfection nothing else could have blighted,"" says Spencer Brydon . ""Oh you don't care either--but very differently: you don’t care for anything but yourself,"" he says . But he hasn't spoiled his speaking--"" She faltered . Alice Staverton was a dim secondary social success--and all with people who had truly not an idea of him . It was all mere surface sound, this murmur of their welcome, this popping of their corks--just as his gestures of response were the extravagant shadows, emphatic in proportion as they meant little, of some game of _ombres . Then he could, as seemed to him, most intimately wander and wait, linger and listen . he always caught the steel point of his stick on the old marble of the hall pavement . This effect was the dim reverberating tinkle as of some far-off bell hung who should say where? he put his stick noiselessly away in a corner--feeling the place once again in the likeness of some great glass bowl . he found himself at moments--once he had placed his single light on some mantel-shelf or in some recess--stepping back into shelter or shade, effacing himself behind a door or in an embrasure, as he sought of old the vantage of rock and tree . it made him feel, this acquired faculty, like some monstrous stealthy cat; he wondered if he would have glared at these moments with large shining yellow eyes . he liked the open shutters; he opened everywhere those Mrs. Muldoon had closed . this was human actual social; this was of the world he had lived in . He had support of course mostly in the wide front and the prolonged side; it failed him considerably . ""He's _there_, at the top, and waiting--not, as in general, falling back for disappearance,"" says Brydon . he argued with his hand on the banister and his foot on the lowest stair, in which position he felt as never before the air chilled by his logic . ""He has been dodging, retreating, hiding, but now, worked up to anger, he'll fight!"" he says . apprehension of knowing it must after a little have grown in him . he had been surprised at any rate--of this he _was_ aware--into something unprecedented since his original appropriation of the place . He had closed his eyes, held them tight, for a long minute, as with that instinct of dismay . he mainly felt that, since he hadn't originally scuttled, he had his dignities to preserve and carry aloft . this was before him in truth as a physical image, an image almost worthy of an age of greater romance . The only difference would have been that he might have proceeded downstairs with a drawn sword . david frum: when had he been so close as in this simple, this logical, this completely personal act? he says he knew the blank face of the door to say to him was ""Show us how much you have!"" he asks himself, while panting, he felt his eyes almost leave their sockets . frum says the question of danger loomed: should he just push it open or not? ""If you won't then--I spare you and I give up. You affect me as by the appeal positively for pity,"" says Brydon . he retraced his steps, taking up his candle, burnt, he observed, well-nigh to the socket, and marking again, lighten it as he would, the distinctness of his footfall . ""I respect them then, and I renounce--never, on my honour, to try again."" he was so occupied with the thought of recording his Discretion--as an effect of the vow he had just uttered to his intimate adversary--that the importance of this loomed large and something had overtaken all ironically his sense of proportion . he nursed that sentiment, as the question stood, a little in vain, and even--at the end of he scarce knew, once more, how long--found it . he was so deeply demoralised he could break off at last as for a worse despair . but he had his reason, which over-mastered for the moment everything else . The image of the ""presence"" whatever it was, waiting there for him to go--he hung back from seeing . ""whistling in the dark"" was the top of the stairs, with a fine large dim descent and three spacious landings to mark off . the house, withal, seemed immense, the scale of space again inordinate; the open rooms, to no one of which his eyes deflected, gloomed in their shuttered state . but this nobleness took the form too of the clear delight with which he was finally to sacrifice it . The penumbra, dense and dark, was the virtual screen of a figure which stood in it as still as some image erect in a niche or as some black-vizored sentinel guarding a treasure . Brydon was to know afterwards, was to recall and make out, the particular thing he had believed during the rest of his descent . He saw, in its great grey glimmering margin, the central vagueness diminish, and he felt it to be taking the very form toward Spencer Brydon's bared identity fitted his at _no_ point, made its alternative monstrous . It came upon him nearer now, as one of those expanding fantastic images projected by the magic lantern of childhood . The face was the face of a stranger, but he was not wholly on the ground, but half-raised and upheld . he had come back from further away than any man but himself had ever travelled . But it was strange how with this sense what had brought him back seemed really the great thing, and as if his prodigious journey had been all for the sake of it . Slowly but surely his consciousness grew, his vision of his state thus completing itself . He had been miraculously _carried_ back--lifted and carefully borne as from where he was picked up, the uttermost end of an ""I can only have died. You brought me literally to life,"" Alice Staverton said . ""I was uneasy. You were to have come, you remember--and you had sent no word,"" he said. ""What a long dark day!"" ""As I didn't turn up you came straight--?"" she quavered . ""Well, I've believed at least you'd have been here,"" Brydon said . ""I knew you _would_,"" she said, ""That I'd persist, you mean?"" ""No, thank heaven,"" she repeated, ""it's not you! Of course it wasn't to have been"" ""You couldn't!"" she returned consolingly . ""I _could_ have liked him. And to me,"" Brydon sounded . ""He has been unhappy, he has been ravaged,"" she said . The Foundation can copy and distribute the works in the United States without permission .

La Maternelle," Rose, a young Parisian woman with full academic training is on the eve of marrying. Suddenly her father fails; she loses her dowry, and her fiance disappears. She tries to get work, but soon finds out that her diplomas are more of a hindrance than a help. They inspire only diffidence in administrative circles. Officials always declare her too good for the position. Starvation threatens, and finally she sets to work deliberately trying to appear unintelligent and rude enough to be hired. Thus she succeeds in securing a position as ""femme de service"" in the ""Maternelle"" of the working-class quarter of Menilmontant. A ""Maternelle"" is a district school for children from two to six years, preparatory to the Primary school. To ease her transition to this new environment and ward off thoughts of despair she decides to keep a diary of her daily experiences. This diary shows her to be an extremely kind-hearted woman and at the same time a keen observer. Rose has the lowest tasks in the school: she dusts, sweeps the rooms, lights the fire early in the morning, and she takes care of the children physically, all day round. Although the directress and the two subordinate teachers are her superiors, Rose is the one that comes in closest contact with the children. Rose is the one to whom they go to naturally all the time, as they would to a mother; she washes them when their nose is bleeding, in her arms they find consolation when roughly handled by a schoolmate; in her skirt they hide to find protection against angry and threatening parents. The pupils belong to the working poor, and many of them are so neglected and so miserable in their homes that the school is a better place for them to be. And the school to them is Rose. The children include ""mouse,"" the gentle five-year-old little mother with her brother, her ""chickling;"" Richard, who cannot imagine that there might exist anything like disinterested kindness and he conceives of every relation between two human beings as a bargain; Adam, the strong and noisy leader of the older boys and a great boaster, the girls who admire him because they are afraid of him. The cat Mistigris, who eats little birds and thereby stirs up the wrath of the children.

Orlando Furioso," The action of Orlando Furioso takes place against the background of the war between the Christian emperor Charlemagne and the Saracen King of Africa, Agramante, who has invaded Europe to avenge the death of his father Traiano. Agramante and his allies – who include Marsilio, the King of Spain, and the boastful warrior Rodomonte – besiege Charlemagne in Paris. Meanwhile Orlando, Charlemagne's most famous paladin, has been tempted to forget his duty to protect the emperor through his love for the pagan princess Angelica. At the beginning of the poem, Angelica escapes from the castle of the Bavarian Duke Namo, and Orlando sets off in pursuit. The two meet with various adventures until Angelica saves a wounded Saracen knight, Medoro, falls in love, and elopes with him to Cathay. When Orlando learns the truth, he goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa destroying everything in his path. The English knight Astolfo journeys to Ethiopia on the hippogriff to find a cure for Orlando's madness. He flies up to the moon (in Elijah's flaming chariot no less) where everything lost on earth is to be found, including Orlando's wits. He brings them back in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them, thus restoring him to sanity. (At the same time Orlando falls out of love with Angelica, as the author explains that love is itself a form of insanity.) Orlando joins with Brandimart and Oliver to fight Agramante, Sobrino and Gradasso on the island of Lampedusa. There Orlando kills King Agramante. Another important plotline involves the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero. They too have to endure many vicissitudes. Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress Alcina and has to be freed from her magic island. He also has to avoid the enchantments of his foster father, the wizard Atlante, who does not want him to fight. Finally, Ruggiero converts to Christianity and marries Bradamante. Rodomonte appears at the wedding feast and accuses him of being a traitor to the Saracen cause, and the poem ends with Ruggiero slaying Rodomonte in single combat. Ruggiero and Bradamante are the ancestors of the House of Este, Ariosto's patrons, whose genealogy he gives at length in canto 3 of the poem. The epic contains many other characters, including Orlando's cousin, the paladin Rinaldo, who is also in love with Angelica; the thief Brunello; and the tragic heroine Isabella.

Where Angels Fear to Tread," On a journey to Tuscany with her young friend and traveling companion Caroline Abbott, widowed Lilia Herriton falls in love with both Italy and Gino, a handsome Italian much younger than herself, and decides to stay. Furious, her dead husband's family send Lilia's brother-in-law Philip to Italy to prevent a misalliance, but he arrives too late. Lilia had already married the Italian and becomes pregnant again. While giving birth to her son, she dies. The Herritons send Philip again to Italy, this time to save the infant boy from an uncivilized life and to save the family's reputation. Not wanting to be outdone—or considered any less moral or concerned than Caroline for the child's welfare—Lilia's in-laws try to take the lead in traveling to Italy. In the public eye, they make it known that it is both their right and their duty to travel to Monteriano to obtain custody of the infant so that he can be raised as an Englishman. Secretly, though, they have no regard for the child; only public appearances. Similarly to A Room with a View, both Italy and its inhabitants are presented as exuding an irresistible charm, to which eventually Caroline Abbott also succumbs. However, there is a tragic ending to the novel: the accidental death of Lilia's child, which spurs a series of drastic changes within the story. Gino's physical outburst toward Philip in response to the news makes Philip realize what it is like to truly be alive. The guilt felt by Lilia's sister-in-law Harriet causes her to lose her mind. Finally, in Forster's novel, Philip realizes that he is in love with Caroline Abbott but that he can never have her, because she admits, dramatically, to being in love with Gino. The film by contrast, adds a positive ending to the story by hinting that Caroline's love for Gino may be just a passing fancy, with love between herself and Philip being possible. * Forster, E.M., Where Angels Fear to Tread, ed. by Oliver Stallybrass (London, 1975). * Winkgens, Meinhard, ’Die Funktionalisierung des Italienbildes in den Romanen ""Where Angels Fear to Tread"" von E.M.

He found the situation full of whimsical romance: there was something half attractive, half repellent in the thought of this vulgar woman journey Lilia Theobald, who had attempted interference, began to break up . It was an effort to leave Whitby, and Mrs. Herriton discouraged the effort as far as possible . A house was finally taken for her at Sawston, Caroline Abbott was seeking a companion for a year’s travel . Lilia gave up her house, sold half her furniture, left the other half and Irma with Mrs. Herriton . Philip declared that she was improving . Harriet was curiously virulent about Italy, which she had never visited . The appearance of Irma, just off to school, prevented further discussion . She and her elderly daughter always got on very well, though they had not  Mrs. Herriton took the letter indulgently . ""What is the difficulty?"" said Harriet, returning to Yorkshire . Monteriano, the Mons Rianus of Antiquity, definitely emancipated itself from Poggibonsi in 1261 . It is now of small importance, and seat of the district prison . Mrs. Herriton Irma said it was three bad, and was told not to be rude . Lilia has insulted our family, and she shall suffer for it . A small thing at hand is greater than a great thing remote, and Lilia It was the first time he had anything to do. He kissed his mother and sister and puzzled Irma . Mrs. Herriton wrote to Mrs. Theobald, using plain language about Lilia’s conduct . Milan had known Miss Abbott for years, and had never had much opinion about her one way or the other . All her life had been spent at Sawston with a dull and amiable father, and her pleasant, pallid face, bent on some Philip, whose one physical advantage was his height, felt annoyed at her implied indifference to it . The carriage entered a little wood, which lay brown and sombre across the cultivated hill . There are such violets in England Philip was anxious for himself: he feared that Romance might die . The sooner it goes from us the better . ""I’ll tell you not another word!"" she cried, with a spasm of terror . Philip talked continually, thinking this to be great evidence of resource and tact . It showed Miss Abbott that he had probed her to the bottom, but was able to conquer his disgust, and by sheer force of intellect continue to be as agreeable Lilia, very smart and vociferous, sat by Philip, looking, to his irritated nerves . The face of Signor Carella was twitching too much for Philip to study it . He was Lilia had picked up hardly any of the latter language, and Signor Carella had not yet learnt any . Philip was too cowardly to break forth and denounce the engagement . ""England is a great country. The Philip replied, “I should like to see you now, please, in my room, as I have come all the way on business.” He heard Miss Abbott gasp . Signor Carella, who was lighting a rank cigar, had not understood  I am not blaming you now. But I blame the glamour of Italy--I have felt it myself, you know--and I greatly blame Miss Abbott . Think of your life at home--think of Irma! And Gino appeared so quickly that he must have been listening outside the door . Philip had no intention of doing so; and no more, it seemed, had Gino, who stood nervously in the middle of the room with twitching lips and Philip sprang up, and Gino, who had flung wide his arms to let the glorious creature go, took him by the shoulders and shook him, and said, “Because we are married--married-- Lilia's father wished to make it a patriarchal concern, where all the family should have their rooms and meet together for meals . Her father complained prosperity was corrupting him and making him unsympathetic and hard; his mother  Lilia praised and petted him on his return, calling him brave and a hero and other endearing epithets . They took the cheque not to Poggibonsi, after all, but to Empoli--a Gino became terribly depressed over the solicitors' letter, more depressed than she thought necessary . He spent whole days in the loggia leaning over the parapet or sitting astride it disconsolately . “ In the democracy of the caffe or the street the great question of our life has been solved, and the brotherhood of man is a reality .

A great tall man! And when I am really amused I am often impolite,"" said Spiridione Lilia was delighted to see them, and became more animated than Gino had known her for a long time . The tea tasted of chopped hay, and they asked to drink it out of a wine-glass, and refused milk . Lilia had no religion in her; but for hours at a time she would be seized with a vulgar fear that she was not “married properly” the Herritons were out of the question; they would not even let her write to I Lilia was sprightly, and they thought her quite unconventional, and Gino a charming boy, so all that was to the good . By May the season, such as it was, had finished, and there would be no one till Gino had frightened her too much to leave any place for contempt . He stopped in the house for three days, positively ill with physical collapse . But for all his suffering he had tamed her, and she never Lilia had achieved pathos despite herself, for there are some situations in which vulgarity counts no longer . She cried frequently, making herself look plain and old, which distressed her husband . Suffering, however, is more independent of Lilia had sat with Gino one afternoon in March, her head upon his shoulder, while Caroline was sketching . He wished her good-night, and turned his horses down the corner . As the diligence came round she saw that it Lilia screamed for she told him everything--all she knew and all she thought .

But now it is really a New Life, because we are all at accord . Irma had been told of her mother’s death, and Miss Abbott had also been told . Philip retorted with equal sharpness with sudden sharpness . ""You knew Lilia all your life. I knew what it was about and how severe I could be,"" she said . “I’m afraid that’s rude,” Philip ""I hated the idleness, the stupidity, the respectability, the petty unselfishness,"" he corrected . ""You should have told me this before! Think it still! I agree with lots of it. Magnificent I hated society for a day or two at Monteriano . I didn’t see that all these things are invincible, and that if we go against them they will break us to pieces .

Mrs. Herriton swept into the room, saying, “Come with me, dear, and I will tell you Irma was proof against a single post-card, not against two . A new little brother is a valuable sentimental asset to a school-girl . She had promised not to tell about him--she knew not why Mrs. Herriton had not come across her much since the kiss of reconciliation, nor Philip since the journey to London .

She could not bear to seem less charitable than others . The child’s welfare was a sacred duty to her, not a matter Philip knew nothing of his daughter’s exasperating behaviour . ""I’m afraid it will mean a lot of expense. She will get nothing out of Italy without paying,"" said Mr. Abbott . He could understand enthusiasm, but she did Philip had sent letters from the Caffe Garibaldi . ""I didn’t know I was still such an ass,"" said his mother . “I will not be disgraced by her. I WILL have the child. Pay all Caroline Abbott has been wonderful, says Philip . The expedition promised to be highly comic . He was not averse to it any longer; he was simply indifferent to all in it except the humours . From that moment everything went Italy was beastly, and Florence station is the centre of beastly Italy . But he had a strange feeling that a little influx into him of virtue would make the whole land not beastly but amusing . Philip, to be annoying, answered “No.” “What do they do there?” continued Harriet . “Nothing at all. It’s frightful.” “I know it is. But it’s old-awfully old The Italians never were chivalrous from the first. If you condemn him for that, you’ll condemn the whole lot.” ""And the French as well?” “And the English as well.” “Things aren’t so jo In the spring of the Renaissance a great painter came to visit his friend the Lord of Monteriano . In the interval between the banquets and the discussions on Latin etymology and the dancing, he would stroll over to Philip's presence spoilt the comedy: she would do nothing funny . He tried to think how amusing it was; but it would not do . Perhaps she had seen Gino, and they had prepared some elaborate mortification for Herritons  Perfetta had gone to Poggibonsi . Then she asked Philip for a halfpenny . It took longer to find than the basket, and he remembered it was Lilia’s . Philip paid off the detestable child at the Volterra gate . She got two nickel pieces and was not pleased, partly because it was too much . He caught her fathers and cousins winking at each other . Philip began to see that there were two Miss Abbotts who could travel alone to Monteriano, and the Miss Abbott who could not enter Gino’s house when she got there . It was an amusing discovery. Which of them would respond to his The Italians look on death and love as spectacles . ""You may be right,"" said Miss Abbott, impressed for the first time . Philip smiled, and was shocked at himself for smiling, and smiled again . The view from the Rocca (small gratuity) is finest at sunset, he murmured, more to himself than to her . But she returned to the window, and again her finger pursued the delicate curves . For her, Italians don’t love music silently, like the beastly Germans . The audience takes its share--sometimes more. “Can’t we go?” He turned on her, but not unkindly . “But we’re here to Philip, too, marvelled at his wish to go at Monteriano opera . Miss Abbott and Harriet were both a little shame-faced . They thought of their friends at Sawston . Philip had tried for a box, but all the best were taken: it was rather a grand performance . Harriet was fretful and insular, and insisted on praising everything: her only regret was that she had no pretty Lucia was stout and ugly; but her voice was still beautiful . She was accompanied by sighs, and its top note was drowned in a shout of universal joy . As for Philip, he forgot himself Harriet was always unfortunate. The bouquet struck her full in the chest, and a little billet-doux fell out of it into her lap . “Whose is it?” shouted her brother, holding up the bouquet in one hand Oh, but he has a sense of humour! Here we find what asses we are, for things go off quite easily, all by themselves . I tell you, Miss Abbott, it’s one thing for England and another for Italy It is well to be remembered with love . It is not so very dreadful to be forgotten entirely . if we shall resent anything on earth at all, we shall regret the consecration . ""I have dreamt of a red hen--that is two hundred and five, and a friend unexpected--he means eighty-two,"" he said . he blew a fat smoke-ring on the table and ""You don’t care if you get the profits. You won’t even say ‘Thank you, Gino.’” The ring had extended its pale blue coils towards her . She lost self-control. It enveloped her. Signor Carella is a remarkably fine child for his age . The patronizing words came out gracious and sincere, and he smiled with pleasure . ""You must not stand. Let us sit on the loggia, where it Miss Abbott was furious at this final insult to her dead acquaintance . She glowed and throbbed; her tongue moved nimbly . “I suppose you will say that you love her.” “I shall not say it. ""Whatever I say displeases you, Signorina. God help you, for you are most unfair. You complain that there is no love in this marriage. You say that I ill-treated my dear wife. It is not so. Miss Abbott, for all her goodness, could not comprehend it, though such a thing is more within the comprehension of women . All men vaunt it, and declare that it is theirs; but the hearts of most are set elsewhere . ""I have wasted your time,"" said Miss Abbott . She cursed her feebleness; she longed to expose it, without apologies or tears . It was too late to go. She turned away her head when Gino lifted Philip entered, and saw, to all intents and purposes, the Virgin and Child, with Donor . He knelt by the side of the chair, with his hands clasped before him . “No, do stop!” Perfetta, who had a genius for missing people, returned loudly complaining of the size of Monteriano and the intricacies of its streets . He offered Philip a cigar, and they proceeded to the business . Philip was averse to losing his temper . The access of joy that had come to him promised to be permanent . He was anxious to be charitable towards the world . The sacristan's son was sweeping the nave, more for amusement than for cleanliness . It was freeing a column from its wealth of scarlet calico . Miss Abbott was praying, but he was not much ""If you do no more, that is all we want. You promise not to prejudice our cause by speaking to Signor Carella?"" ""Oh, certainly. I don’t want to speak to him again; I shan’t ever see him You can! Is that all you are after? If I can persuade Signor Carella to give in, so much the better. If he won’t, I must report the failure to my mother and then go home . I don't die--I don’t fall in love. And if others die they always do it when I’m just not there. You are quite right; life to me is just a spectacle, which--thank God, and Gino, a millionaire, was ragging his companion hopelessly . ""Well, I have done my best,"" said Philip, dipping a slice of sugar into his cup . The sugar was now impregnated with coffee, Mrs. Herriton--should he send her sympathetic regards? No; perhaps that would hardly do . Harriet, at all events, lived more graciously in Italian, the very phrases of which entice one to be happy and ""It’s hard luck on her,"" said the landlady . ""She is a good person. I must do for her anything I can,"" he said . It was a nasty evening, but she was beginning to understand Philip shook hands with the landlady, gave the messenger a nickel piece, and drove away . It was part of the idiot’s malady only to receive what was just for his services . He was fright Philip winced, but it was too dark for him to see the child’s face . It went out quickly, but not before he had seen that the baby was crying . ""No, he’s crying hard; I thought so Philip was a good deal hurt. He sat up and rocked himself to and fro, holding his arm . He tried to light a match, holding the box in his teeth and striking at it with the uninjured hand The details of Harriet’s crime were never known, nor did they interest Philip greatly . In her illness she spoke more of the inlaid box that she lent to Lilia--lent, not given--than of recent troubles  Philip had only to get into the uninjured carriage and order the driver to return . It was some time before he realized that she had never missed the child . The woman took him to the reception-room, just as she had taken Miss Gino had broken his finger-nails against the stove . It broke against one of the trees below . Then he was seized with remorse, and knelt beside his adversary and tried to Philip's one thought was to get away from that room at whatever sacrifice of nobility or pride . He crawled quickly to where Philip lay and had him clean by the elbow . The whole arm seemed red-hot, and the broken bone Philip looked away from the great pictures where visible forms suddenly become inadequate for the things they have shown to us . Philip was happy; he would try henceforward to be worthy of the things she had revealed . ""I do not care for milk; finish ""It does not matter. It will never be wanted any more,"" said Philip . ""I heard from him this morning, just as we left Milan. He finds he has gone too far to back out. It would be expensive. I don’ Philip looked mournfully out of the window at the decreasing streams . He was convalescent, both in body and spirit, but convalescence brought no joy . “I’m sorry. When will you come back, do you think?” he Miss Abbott had a short paroxysm of illness and remorse . She soon ceased to realize anything was wrong beyond the death of a poor little child . But she returned feeling that Harriet considered the affair as settled I’ll quote what you said to me: ‘Don’t be mysterious; there isn’t the time.’ You can’t live at Sawston’s . “I’ve wanted often to tell you, and then been afraid.” Philip Herriton, a dentist with a pretty face, isn’t it funny? Then, to his relief, she began to cry . Philip managed to think not of himself but of her . He did not lament.

Simon," The story begins on the eve of the English Civil War in 1642. Simon Carey is the school age son of John and Anne Carey, of Lovacott Farm, near Great Torrington in Devon. He has a sister, christened Marjory, whom he always calls ""Mouse"". One day he is the house of his best friend Amias Hannaford with whom he does his schoolwork, when Amias's father Doctor Hannaford announces that the king has raised his standard at Nottingham, and calls for a toast to the king. Simon refuses, because he and his family support Parliament. This leads to a falling out between the families. Simon's father goes off to fight for Parliament but orders Simon to finish school first. One day while Simon is getting his horse Scarlet reshoed in town, a rider falls down in front of him after being pursued and almost run over by the following horses. He and the smith rescue the young rider. Through his knowledge of the area and the introduction of the rescued man Barnaby Colbourne, a Parliament man, he manages to lead retreating Parliament troops under Colonel Ireton past a Royalist stronghold to safety. A few months later, after finishing his education, Simon goes to Windsor to join the New Model Army. He is fortunate to fall in again with Lieutenant Colebourne who recommends him to General Thomas Fairfax. Simon is commissioned as cornet to Colbourne in the Fairfax Horse. One of his subordinates is the devout Corporal, former Ironside 'Zeal-for-the-Lord' Relf. He first sees action in the decisive Battle of Naseby. After the battle Corporal Relf deserts, having learned that his neighbour has stolen all his money from him. He is recaptured and sentenced to the Pioneer regiment, one of the harshest of units, but escapes. Simon's troop heads west and is ordered to capture a house at Okeham Paine, near Exeter, which is held by the Royalists. When they break through he finds himself fighting Amias, who is with the Royalists. Simon is knocked unconscious by a musket butt and is tended by the formidable lady of the house, Mistress Killigrew. He meets and falls in love with her daughter Susanna. After his recovery he is ordered to go to Lovacott to act as a go-between for messages from Parliament spies in the area under Royalist control. One turns out to be Corporal Relf, now called Ishmael Watts, who is hiding with another spy, Podbury, in the tower of Torrington Church above the powder store. While Simon is at home, a Royalist search party led by Amias turns the house upside down, Simon's sister describes him ""not quite 'zactly"", i.e., not quite right after his head injury, and Amias chooses to believe this to stop further enquiry from his subordinates. It is then that Simon realises their friendship is still alive. When he hears the Parliament army is in Torrington, he rejoins them for the battle there. The Royalists are defeated and 200 prisoners are put in the church. When a huge explosion blows up the church, suspicion falls upon a red-headed man whom Simon recognizes as Amias, because he used a phrase they used as children. He finds him outside the town and brings his doctor father to him. Amias said it wasn't he who blew up the church. Simon is unaware he is being followed by Cornet Wainwright, who has disliked him since Simon took his coveted position as cornet. He and Amias are arrested. Amias is cleared when the dying Ishmael Watts (Corporal Relf) tells the chaplain Joshua Sprigg and General Fairfax that the explosion was an accident. The General forgives Simon, comparing his actions to those of the Biblical Jonathan who protected his friend David. The story ends four years later at Lovacott in April 1649. Simon resigned from the army at the same time as General Fairfax, because both disagreed with the decision to execute the king, although they otherwise approve of the Commonwealth. A ghost from the past, Podbury, reappears and the mystery of the blast that killed 200 Royalists seems to be solved. Simon and Amias are fast friends again and look set to marry Susanna Killigrew and 'Mouse' respectively.

Mais quand, après tout, il aurait  Je n'ai toujours été un homme sage et donnant le bon exemple, mais je veux dire que mademoiselle de Fougères est une gaillarde bien tournée e M.

Simon baisa encore ce sang généreux et essuya ses doigts à nu sur sa poitrine . Il lui fallait revoir mademoiselle de Fo Ce n'était pas un enfant, la femme qui se condamnait au silence et à la feinte depuis six mois plutôt que d'échanger ses nobles pensées avec des êtres Mademoiselle de Fougères était indépendante par son caractère et par sa position . Mais Simon eût rougi de rechercher la main d'une riche hérit Le sacristain fut dépêché auprès de mademoiselle de Fougères pour la prier de ne pas manquer d'assister à la bénédiction du saint  Mademoiselle de Fougères n'était pas une personne que l'on pût accuser, comme son père, de courtiser la popularité . On lui reprochait le défaut contraire, Jeanne Féline n'aurait pas le dernier mot; car il se retourna vivement de l'autre côté et se mit à encenser la tribune seigneuri Jeanne et Fiamma ne s'ennuyait pas un instant dans la compagnie d'une femme qui n'avait jamais lu que la Bible .

Seven Little Australians," The seven children of the title live in 1880s Sydney with their father, an army Captain who has little understanding of his children, and their twenty year-old stepmother Esther who can exert little discipline on them. Accordingly they wreak havoc wherever possible, for example by interrupting their parents while they entertain guests and asking for some of their dinner (implying to the guests that the children's own dinner is inadequate). After a prank by Judy and Pip embarrasses Captain Woolcot at his military barracks he orders that Judy, the ringleader, be sent away to boarding school in the Blue Mountains. Meg comes under the influence of an older girl, Aldith, and tries to improve her appearance according to the fashions of the day. She and Aldith make the acquaintance of two young men, but Meg believes she has fallen in love with the older brother of one, Alan. When Aldith and Meg arrange to meet the young men for a walk, Meg is embarrassed after a note goes astray and Alan comes to the meeting instead and reproaches her for becoming 'spoilt', rather than remaining the sweet young girl she was. Meg returns home and later faints, having tight-laced her waist until it affects her health. Unhappy away from her siblings, Judy runs away from school and returns home, hiding in a barn. Despite her ill-health as a result of walking for several days to get home, the other children conceal her presence from their father, but he discovers her. He plans to send her back to school however realises that she is suffering from tuberculosis, and she is allowed to remain at home. In part to assist Judy's recuperation, the children and Esther are invited to visit Esther's parents at their sheep station Yarrahappini. One day the children go on a picnic far away from the property. A ringbarked tree falls and threatens to crush the youngest child, 'the General'. Judy, who promised 'on her life' not to allow him to be harmed on the picnic, rushes to catch him and her body protects him from the tree. However her back is broken and she dies before help can be fetched. After burying Judy on the property, the family returns home to Sydney sobered by her death. While ostensibly things remain the same, each character is slightly changed by their experience. In particular Captain Woolcot regrets the fact that he never really understood Judy and tries to treasure his remaining children a little more.

It was a nursery without a nurse, so that partly accounted for it . She was only twenty--just a lovely, laughing Bunty was six, and was fat and very lazy . He hated scouting at cricket, he loathed the name of a paper-chase . I think the artist must just have dreamed of Nell, and reproduce I haven't introduced you to Pip yet, have I? He was a little like Judy, only handsomer and taller, and he was fourteen . It was generally believed in the family that she wrote poetry and stories, and even kept a diary  ""I'm going down to ask for some roast fowl,"" says Pip . ""I can't forget the smell of it, and they'd got a lot on the table,"" says Meg . Nell looked up with shy, lovely eyes, ""I don't know what has possessed you two to-night,"" says Captain Woolcot . The last word was a terrible effort; Meg's appearance with the two portions of fowl was hailed with uproarious applause . "" Esther gathered up the dear, dirty-faced young rascal and bore him struggling out of the room . At the foot of the stairs she nearly stumbled over the rest of the family . ""Your father says you're a disgraceful Esther snatched one of the pins from Esther's dress, fastening her own with it . ""You are the untidiest, most unruly lot of children in Sydney,"" Esther says . It's  ""I came to study, sir,"" said the Captain, with a frown . ""I won't waste all the holidays, when I'm costing you so much in school fees,"" said Pip . He examined them with admiration plainly depicte ""I thought perhaps you would like a little lunch, Father,"" she said gently . ""I would as soon drink the water the maids wash up in, my child,"" he said . Judy was mowing the lawn in the blazing sunshine . ""Sure, an' it's illigence itsilf this side: you wouldn't be afther leaving half undone, like a man with only one cheek shaved,"" he says . ""You can finish it then Bunty conceived the idea of cleaning the whole lot and standing them in a neat row to meet his father's delighted eyes . At the sound of his footsteps, Baby turned round and lifted a perspiring little face to his . Poor Baby never finished Bunty shivered from head to foot, his legs huddled up, his head between his knees . The next minute his father was in the room, and he crushed himself into it . ""I didn't--I haven ""I'd have fowl three times a day, and the pantomime seven nights a week,"" Judy says . ""You really are the most exasperating children,"" Esther says in a breath . Meg, for goodness' sake ""Six whole tickets wasted--thirty beautiful shillings-just because we have a father!"" Bunty volunteered, and wrote on envelope, 'With compts. J. C. Woolcot.' Meg moaned Pip gave a gurgling, captivating laugh and held up his arms . ""The General loves going on the water,"" she said, squeezing the baby on the seat between them . A wind from the river swept through the belt of gum trees ""I've got a plan that will do, I think,"" Pip said quietly . ""Only I'm going to leave the General here at the Barracks for a couple of hours till we come back,"" she said . Pat told them they must Pip, a sister of Pip's, has been to the Aquarium for two mortal hours . ""Go and see if that's the Bondi tram coming,"" he said again . Pip pushed his hat to the back of his head and ""I am sorry you should have overheard us, Miss Woolcot,"" Judy nodded quietly . ""You come, too, Pip,"" Judy said, as she turned the handle . A little figure stepped into the middle of the group, a little figure with Pip was explosive. He called her a little ass and a stupid idiot for doing such a thing . ""I'm really sorry, too, that I made a laughing-stock of him up there,"" Pip said . Then Pip got Esther and the whole family came in for an immense amount of vituperation . Then Pip received a thrashing, in spite of Judy's persistent avowal that it was all her fault . She remembered wondering whether she would be Esther sat bolt upright in bed at the sight of Esther's sorrowful face . She gulped down a great lump in her throat, and her poor little face grew white and drawn . ""You always were the sort to die game,"" Est Meg hung on her arm sobbing; Pip dug his heel in the hearthrug . She looked like a miniature tragedy queen going to immediate execution . In a minute he returned with a pickle bottle, containing an enormous green f ""Let her stay--oh! do letter stay, we'll be good always,"" says Esther . Meg's hair had always been pretty, but during the last two months she had cut herself a fringe . Aldith MacCarth Aldith grew dissatisfied with her waist . She never called her friend Meg, pronouncing that name to be ""too domestic and altogether unlovely"" Meg had already brought it within a girdle of twenty- ""You are a horrid old pig, Aldiff MacCatfy,"" her sister says . Meg pushed her gently aside, catching Aldith's half-scornful smile . ""Oh, send her away, Margue Aldith's eldest sister was engaged to be married! ""I knew it would come--I have seen it coming for a long time. Oh! I'm not easily blinded,"" Meg said . ""I know true love when I Meg fell down her full length in a most undignified manner, right across the muddy sidewalk . She trimmed and retrimmed her hats, altered her dresses, read her novels, and sat in front of the looking-glass with her hair Australian girls nearly always think of ""lovers and nonsense,"" as middlefolks call it, long before their English aged sisters do . in this land of youthfulness it is the rule more frequently than the exception, and herein lies the chief defect of the very Aldith Evelyn MacCarthy had fallen in love as nearly as it is possible for sweet sixteen to fall in love . He was a handsome lad of eighteen, still a schoolboy, but possessed of fascinating manners and a Aldith grew a trifle thin and large-eyed, and used to make copious notes in her diary every night . ""This is appalling! Whatever do you mean, Miss MacCarthy?"" James Graham said, with exagger Aldith: ""I will never forgive you if you don't come,"" Meg faltered, the crimson in her cheeks again . She longed inexpressibly for a confidante who would advise her what to do at this ""I must ask you, please, not to kiss me. I don't like kissing at all,"" Flossie Courtney wrote . Aldith had a dread that he might fulfil his promise, if she did not forbid him Aldith's dainty little note was transferred to Bunty's pocket . He lost ten, exclusive of his best agate, and returned with saddened spirits . Now Meg had promised him eight chocolate walnuts on his return ""You can have my new c--c-catapult,"" he whispered once, giving her a tearful, imploring look . Pip said it was because he was a coward, and had not the moral courage to Bunty: ""You're only a girl, so I don't 'spect it would be very much good to you, would it?"" ""No, you needn't. Here, take it, and hurry back: think of your map,"" Meg ""I am quite a good hand at it, though you may not think so,"" said Meg, in a choking voice . ""Andrew!"" she said, in an indescribable tone . He leaned back against he fence and ""I shouldn't have spoken as I did at first--I was a perfect brute,"" he said remorsefully . Meg lifted her face half a second, white and pathetic in the moonlight, and all wet with Meg flung off her cloud, smoothed her ruffled hair, peeped in the hall-stand glass to see if the night wind had taken away the trace of her recent tears . She sang ""Within a mile of Edinboro Esther had been having a lonely game of cricket down in the paddock by himself . But even with a brand-new cricket ball this game palls after a time when one has to bowl and bat and backstop in solitary state . He ""Go and tell Pat I want him instantly,"" the Captain says . Bunty had the horse's leg in his hand and was examining it anxiously . But he went up to the stables and sent Pat posthaste back to his father . "" ""I've run away, Bunty,"" Judy said, in a quavering voice . ""I want to see you all so badly,"" she said . Then a tear or two of weakness and self-pity trickled from beneath her black ""I feel I've had nothing to eat since yesterday morning,"" she said . ""I'm awf'ly sorry, Judy,"" he said gently, but the others are all out. Wouldn't I do? I'd do anything, Judy's Embrocation, or arnica, is the last place he should expect it to be in . ""I left it on my bedroom mantelpiece, but somebody has seen fit to meddle with it,"" the Captain said . Judy had forgone three ""I don't mix the pastry with it to make it lightsome, leastway not ordinarily,"" says Martha Tomlinson . Bunty's shoe was don at the heel, and in trying to recover her balance, she knocked over a Judy moaned, moving her head restlessly from side to side . ""Oh, how my feet ache! no--my head, and my side--oh! I don't know what it is!"" Bunty said gruffly . Meg hurried on, and Pip and Nell followed in blank amazement . ""I've got her up in the shed here, and I went and got corned beef,"" Meg said . Meg was utterly disbelieving the ""You should have done t you shouldn't really, you know, old girl,"" says Pip . ""I'd never forgive whoever told him. I can only stay a week,"" Pip tells Martha . Pip: ""I must go back ""How COULD you do it? Where did you sleep, Judy? What did you eat?"" Meg exclaimed, in deep distress . ""I had seven shillings in a bit of paper in my pocket, as well as the three-and- Martha Tomlinson remarked to her fellow-servant and sufferer, Bridget, that blessed children were in a conspiracy to put her ""over the river"" Bridget's digestion was impaired that morning, and she was exceedingly unhappy . ""You couldn ""Get out with you!"" said Martha, choking him with dust . Meg had a chair to sit in, a table to eat at, even a basin in which to perform her ablutions . The girls and Bunty had no Pip had to go to school late and come back early, cajoling notes of excuse . Meg besought her to run no risks; but Bunty and Nell were eager for it . ""I'm sure we could manage it especially as it ""I'm not doin' nothin',"" Bunty says . ""Suppose you come here and confess every bit of mischief you've done this week,"" he said . The Captain said he was p--playin' marbles  ""I'll thrash this mean spirit of lying and cowardice out of you,"" says his father . ""You've killed me!"" Swish, swish. ""Going to a picnic, are you? You can picnic in your room till ""I shouldn't mind camping here myself for a little time,"" he said . But he dismissed the idea as hardly compatible with dignity . ""What is it you want, John?"" he called, in a vibrating voice at the foot of the ""I am ashamed to own him for my son,"" Esther said in surprise . Pip threw sticks on the fire and said coolly: ""Only a friend of Meg's, a frightened kind of kid who has quite a Esther and Nell all sat down helplessly where he told them, and watched his face anxiously . He selected a pipe from the row over the mantelpiece, fitted a new mouthpiece to it, and carefully filled it . ""I am ""Have you anything to say for yourself, Helen?"" he repeated . ""No excuse or reason at all?"" ""No, Father."" ""A train goes in an hour and a half, you will come straight back with me this moment,"" the Captain says . Judy feared she should be compelled to tidy habits on her recovery . Bunty brought in the white mice and the blind French guinea-pig, and let them run loose over the counterpane . ""I wasn't goin' to make Esther mended more rapidly, surprising even the doctor with her powers of recuperation . In three weeks she was about the house again, thin and great-eyed, but full of nonsense and even mischief once more . The Captain smoked four big cigars Esther's old home was very far away, but she had not seen it since her marriage . ""The hospitality of squatters is world-famed, but this breaks all previous records,"" Esther says . The Captain placed the cigar back in the Yarrahappini was on the borders of the Never-Never Land . he only received eighteenpence change out of the ten pounds he had tendered . There were sportsmen going two hundred miles after quail and wallaby Nell and Baby had had a quarrel over the puffing out of the air-cushions, and were too tired and cross to make it up again; Judy's head ached, and the noise, was not calculated to cure it; Meg Esther rushed out into the rain and hurried them all off into the buggies . There was a twenty-five-mile drive before them yet . The General wept with hardly a break from start to finish, greatly to Esther' ""Oh, where IS the house?"" Bunty said, peeping through Pip's arm on the box seat . Esther gathered her right up in her arms, and they kissed and clung to each other till they were both crying . Just as the sun began to smile and chase away the sky's heavy tears, they all went to bed again to make up for the broken night . Yarrahappini is the kind of sunshine that pushes the thermometer's silver thread up to 100 de The cottage was occupied by the son of an English baronet, who kept the Yarrahappini business books and gave out the stores . Twenty years ago he had helped to make a steady foundation for the red cottage that had arrived ready built on a ""I'm afraid we disturbed you in the middle of your breakfast,"" Meg says . She whipped up a handful and pocketed them when everyone was looking at the mountain of candles . ""I wouldn't dream of using a bought candle, any more Meg asked for ""something very quiet"" in a whisper, Judy and Pip couldn't hear . She was given a ruggy horse that had carried Mrs. Hassal eighteen years ago . ""I can't see any shed or anything Pip had been casting about for some fresh occupation, far he was a boy to whom variety was the salt of life . At first he had been certain he could never tire of shooting rabbits . He had been very scornful about his enthusiasm when  a pair of old serge trousers fastened round the waist with a leathern belt . Mr. Hassal was there on a well-groomed roan; he had three stock-whips, two quite sixteen feet long, the Pip ate enough salt beef and damper to half kill him, drank more tea than he had ever disposed of at one sitting in all his fourteen years . He entertained his sisters and Bunty with a graphic account of the day's proceedings  Pip was going to be a stockman, brand and draft cattle all the days of his life . Meg thought she should marry the richest squatter in Australia, and have the Governor and the Premier come up for shooting and ""things,"" and give balls Mr. Hassal placed the great trolly in charge of four men, with instructions to pick up a couple of men from distant huts to help in the task . From the trees the bell-bird, the coach-whip, the tewinga The bullocks moved a LEETLE bit faster than snails when they crept along over about ten miles . They were in a great grassed paddock that at one end fell abruptly down to the ravine and swamp lands known as ""Isn't it lonely?"" Meg asked. ""What do you do with yourself when you're, not outside?"" Baby said, ""On Cwismas day?"" ""Smoke,"" he said . ""Don't you ever forget how ""Perhaps if she were alive now I should not be quite so contemptible,"" Meg said . ""You remind me of a little sister I had who died"" Meg's face flushed scarlet, and a shamed look had come Miss Meg sat up in horror after hearing the phrase applied to too many of the station hands . She had heard he had ridden over to the next station on business for Mr. Hassal . ""I have to give you this again,"" Mr. G ""I want you to give it to me again, little Miss Meg,"" Meg says . ""My influence is evidently useless--that bit of ribbon would make no difference in the future,"" she said . Meg's heart and head had a rapid battle ""Oh-h-h!"" said Meg, who was in trouble, because wickedness was abhorrent to her . He threw a few more little stones, so that the pain might teach him a lesson he could not forget . Meg Miss Judy shook back her dark tangle: ""Where IS your hat, Miss Judy?"" Meg pushed the bag of fruit across the cloth to her, and tried to tilt her hat over her tell-tale eyes . She took half a dozen great ""You rogue!"" Judy called, pretending to run very quickly . There was a tree falling, one of the great, gaunt, naked things that had been ringbarked long ago . Then there came up across the plain a puff of ""You must watch by her, give her water if she asks,"" he says . ""If it is, it means death,"" Pip says, and dare not leave her unprepared . She sprang after him; ""God knows!"" she Meg's lips moved, but her tongue uttered no word . ""Meg, I'm so frightened! MEG, I can't die!

She kissed him with pale lips once, twice; she gave him both her hands, and her last smile . Meg was glad the little mound looked to the east; the suns died behind it .

Tom Sawyer Abroad," In the story, Tom, Huck, and Jim set sail to Africa in a futuristic hot air balloon, where they survive encounters with lions, robbers, and fleas to see some of the world's greatest wonders, including the Pyramids and the Sphinx. Like Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, Detective, the story is told using the first-person narrative voice of Huck Finn. It is a sequel, set in the time following the title story of the Tom Sawyer series.
","Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all the adventures we had down the river, and the time we set the darky Jim free and Tom got shot in the leg . No, it only just p’isoned him for more. That was all the effect it had . For as much as thirty years he’d been the only man in the village Parsons’ travels happened like this: When he first got to be postmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter for somebody he didn’t know, and there wasn’t any such person in the village . Well, at last he couldn’t stand it any longer; he had the letter buried under the Nat Parsons jumped in and shoved out to the President’s house with his letter, and they told him the President was up to the Capitol . Nat slammed the door, and away they went a-ripping over the roughest road a body ever see . He passed his arms through the loops and hung on for Tom Sawyer had to work his bullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it . The more they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses . He was in time and just in time, and caught the President and give him the letter . Tom Sawyer's way, I can say that for him, but I notice they always git come up with; all you got to do is wait . Well, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us what it was. It was a crusade. I don’t care to, nuther. Mars Tom, I reckon dey’s a mistake about it somers—dey mos’ sholy is. I’s religious myself, en I knows plenty religious people, but I hain’t run across none dat acts like dat.” It made Tom hot, and Jim he couldn’t say nothing, and then he Tom Sawyer was always reading Walter Scott’s book, which he was reading . But it _was_ a wild notion, because in my opinion he never could’ve raised the men . So at last, Tom got up one thing after another, but they all had tender spots about ’em somewheres, and he had I reckon he couldn’t help it; he was just a genius, which wasn’t his fault . The part the professor was in was like a boat, and was big and roomy, and had water-tight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of things in, and a body could sit on them, and make The Widder Douglas always told me the earth was round like a ball, but I never took any stock in a lot of them superstitions o’ hers . I used to go up on the hill, and take a look around and prove it for myself, because I could see myself that the world was the shape of a plate I can sail the skies all my life if I want to, and steer where I please, though they laughed at that, and said I couldn’t . He made Tom steer the ship all about and every which way, and learned it in nearly no time; and Tom said it was perfectly easy; and he flung out printed bills to them that Tom Sawyer was for slipping back there by himself to see if he couldn’t get at the steering-gear and land the ship . After getting to the middle of the boat he crept slower than ever, and it did seem like years to me . But at last we see him get to the professor’s head, and sort TOM EXPLAINS We went to sleep about four o’clock, and woke up about eight . The professor told us not to come abaft the midship compass . It makes a body feel pretty near comfortable, even when he is up in a balloon with a genius . Illinois is green, Indiana is pink. You show me any pink down here, if you can . You never see a person so aggravated and disgusted . He says: “It ain’t no lie; I’ve seen it on the map, and it’s pink.” “Well, then, how’s I don’t reckon I could ’a’ done it again—but I did it that time . I’ve often thought of that time, and I can remember just the way everything looked, same as if it was only last week . And I can see it all: beautiful rolling country with woods and fields and lakes for hundreds and hundreds of Mars Tom, _dey_ don’t know nothin’, lost his temper . Then he saw another clock away off down yonder, and took a look, and it was an hour fast too . He said: “That’s a mighty curious thing” . “Tom Sawyer, you don 'Cose dey is. _Well_, den! I never heard such ignorance. There ain’t no discriminating about it. When he makes you and some more of his children black, what do you call that? Jim sees the p’int. He couldn’t answer. “He does discriminate, I couldn’t see that we ever gained an inch on that ring . It made a body feel creepy, it was so curious and unaccountable . The professor never stirred till the sun was overhead, then he stood up and put a kind of triangle to his eye, and Tom said it was a sext Then he ciphered a little and looked in a book, and then began to carry on again . He said lots of wild things, and, among others, he said he would keep up this hundred-mile gait till the middle of to-morrow afternoon . By and by Tom pinched me and whispers: The professor let off a shout and jumped for him, and straight off it was pitch-dark again, and Jim groaned out, “Po’ Mars Tom, he’s a goner!” Then we heard a couple of terrible screams, and then another that was ’way below, and you could only The professor had laid in everything a body could want; he couldn’t ’a’ been better fixed . There wasn’t milk for the coffee, but there was water, and everything else you could want, and a charcoal stove and the fixings for it, and pipes and matches; and wine and liquor, which warn’t in our Tom Sawyer, the Erronort_, said it would stump old Nat Parsons, the postmaster, when it come along in the mail . He raked and scraped around in his mind, but he couldn’t find nothing, so he had to say: “I don’t believe there’s _any Jim knew more about birds than both of us put together . You see, he had killed hundreds and hundreds of them . That’s the way people does that writes books about birds . I could have been an ornithologer myself, because I always loved birds and creatures . Tom and Jim had taken it for the sea in a dead ca’m; but we were so high up, anyway, that if it had been the sea and rough, it would 'a' looked smooth, all the same, in the night, that way . As we slanted along down, the weather began to moderate, and pretty Tom was aboard by this time, and he started the balloon up a little, and stopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten or twelve feet above ground . It was delicious to be out of his reach, perfectly delicious, and made me feel good and thankful all up one side; but I was hanging there helpless and couldn’ Tom was so excited he couldn’t hold still; but I wasn’t . He was full of his discovery, as he called it, and said the lions and the sand meant the Great Desert . At this time of the year the sun went down, and it was half-past five o’clock by the Gr You see how the shoulder of Africa sticks out to the west . Think how fast we’ve traveled; if we had gone straight east we would be long past England by this time . I reckon maybe you’ve got a chance now to find out whereabouts this balloon is . We swooped down, now, all of a sudden, and stopped about a hundred yards over their heads . The men all set up a yell, and some of them fell flat on their stomachs, some began to fire their guns at us, and the rest broke and scampered every which way, and so did the The last man to go snatched up a child and carried it off in front of him on his horse . Tom took the hellum, and started for that yahoo, and we come a-whizzing down . We knocked him out of the saddle, child and all; and he was jarred considerable  Jim said he reckoned a balloon was the fastest thing in the world, unless it might be some kinds of birds—a wild pigeon, maybe, or a railroad . He said in de fust place he ain’t a bird, strickly speakin’— and that was a fle a man can jump more than three hundred times his own length in a second . It’s ninety miles a minute; it’s considerable more than five thousand miles an hour . A person can learn them 'most anything; and they learn it quicker than any other cretur in the world, too . Jim couldn’t believe it; so we had to drop down to the sand and git a supply and see . They went for me and Jim by the thousand, but not a one of them lit on Tom . The longer we were in that solemn, peaceful desert, the more the hurry and fuss got kind of soothed down Tom said we were right in the midst of the Arabian Nights now . He said it was right along here that one of the cutest things in that book happened . It was a tale about a camel-driver that had lost his camel, and he come along in the desert and meets a man . Mars Tom, dey ain’t no _sense_ in a tale dat acts like dat . He whirls on me and says: “What do _you_ think of the tale?” He says . It graveled him like the nation, too, I reckon, much as he tried not to let on Tom reckoned they had been laying there for years . Some of the men had rusty guns by them, some had swords on and shawl belts with long, silver-mounted pistols stuck in them . Then we mounted high and sailed away, and pretty soon that black spot on the sand was out of a body don’t know what real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through and is certain he ain’t ever going to come to any water any more . At last I couldn’t stand it to look around on them baking plains; I laid down on the locker, and gave it up, and there she Tom Sawyer says: “What’s the use you talking that kind of stuff, Mars Tom? Didn’t I see the lake?” “Yes—you think you did.” “I tell you you _didn’’t_ see it either—because it warn’t there to see.” “You ain’t only res We went a-tearing along toward it, piling the miles behind us like nothing, but never gaining an inch on it . When he got his breath he says, gasping like a fish: “I’d ruther die den have de night ketch us in it ag’in en de ghos Tom and Jim clumb down and spelled me, and me and Jim had a foot-race and a boxing-mill, and I don’t reckon I ever had such a good time in my life . It warn’t so very hot, because it was close on to evening, and we hadn’t any clothes on lions and tigers were sorting out the clothes, and trying to divide them up so there would be some for all, but there was a misunderstanding about it somewheres . There must 'a' been fifty of them, all mixed up together, snorting and roaring and snapping and biting and tearing It was a most amazing good supper we had; lion steak, tiger steak, and hot corn-pone . We got it out of the top of a monstrous tall tree, and there it bursted out like a feather-duster . There was only big loose bunches of things like oversized grape a lot of other animals come to dinner; sneaking yelpers that Tom allowed was jackals, and roached-backed ones that he said was hyenas; and all the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the time . It was like having a front seat at From New York to the Pacific is 2,600 miles . From one end of the Great Desert to the other is 3,200 . With the Desert’s bulk you could cover up every last inch of the United States . Tom Sawyer was tired of that end of the subject, so we got back to talking about the size of the Desert again, and the more we compared it with this and that and t’other thing, the more nobler and grander it got to look right along . Then he showed us the spread the Empire of China made on the map The dervish said: “Don’t you own these camels?” “Yes, they’re mine.” “Are you in debt?” “Who—me? No.” The camel-driver owned up that it was so. Then the Dervish says: “God has made you rich, and He has made me poor. So the camel-driver came a-running and overtook the dervish and says: “You ain’t in society, you know, and you don’t really need all you’ve got. Won’t you be good, and let me have 10 of your camels?” “Well,” the Dervish Uncle Abner was down on them people that’s all the time trying to dig a lesson out of everything that happens, no matter whether—“ Jim was asleep . When you come to look at it it ain’t nobody’s fault in particular; both of them’s to blame . But you rake a match to light Jim said he hadn’t been asleep; he just shut his eyes so he could listen better . He let into the camel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him .

You call that dervish so dread We landed, but it warn’t as interesting as I thought it was going to be, because we couldn’t find the place where they went in to git the treasure . Jim said he wou’dn’t ’a’ missed it for three dollars, and I felt the same way . He had the best head on him The caravan camped, during the middle part of the day, and started again about the middle of the afternoon . Before long the sun started to look very curious . First it kind of turned to brass, and then to copper, and after that it began to look like a blood-red ball . Pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up We had come to know some of them so well that we called them by name when we was talking about them, and soon got so familiar and sociable that we even dropped the Miss and Mister and just used their plain names without any handle . The more you join in with people in their joys and their sorrows, the more nearer they come to Jim allowed us to live as good a life as he could, so we could see them again in a better world .

She jes’ rained in—never cos’ us a lick o’ work. But Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy he never heard him . “How is dat, Mars Tom? Go on, Tom Sawyer was stumped; he sees Jim had got him where he couldn’t budge . He tried to wiggle out by saying they had _forgot_ to put on that tax, but they’d be sure to remember about it, next session of Congress, and then they'd put it on . Tom he tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another speculation for us that would be just as good as this one and better, but it didn’t do no good . The sand was looking so lovely before, just like gold and di’monds, and the feel of it was so soft and so silky and nice, Jim was the gratefulest nigger I ever see, for any little thing you done for him . By and by Jim was 'most dead, but not with work but with laughing' The next few meals were pretty sandy, but that don’t make no difference when you are hungry, and so a little grit in the meat ain Ole Jim ain’t worthy to see dis day!” And then he just broke down and cried, he was so thankful . Jim was excited because the land was so full of history—Joseph and his brethren, Jacob coming down into Egypt to buy corn, the silver cup in the sack, and Tom slammed on the back-action, and as we slowed to a standstill a man’s face as big as our house looked in over the gunnel . Tom was on his knees with his hands clasped, gazing up at the thing in a begging way, and working his lips, We stood off a piece, and sailed around it and over it, and it was just grand . It was a man’s head, or maybe a woman’s, on a tiger’s body a hundred and twenty-five foot long . All but the head used to be under the sand, for Tom was very indignant, and asked him why he didn’t show the flag and command them to _git_, in name of the United States . He said: “You’ll see that they’ll have to apologize for insulting the flag, and pay an indemnity, too, on top of it even if they  Tom glowered at me a minute, and says: “What’s the reason I don’t? What’s to hender me? This balloon is a good enough reason it could happen, I should reckon.” “You tell me the reason it _could_ happen,” “_Why_ is it? I never saw such Jim chirk, ef Huck ain’t got him ag’in! Huck’s landed him high en dry dis time, I tell you . He was so full of laugh he got to strangling and couldn’t go on . But Tom was so mad to see how neat I had floor There were churches, but they don’t know enough to keep Sunday; they keep Friday and break the Sabbath . What I wanted to see was a dervish, because I was interested in dervishes on accounts of the one that played the trick on the camel-driver . I never see anything like it.

The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood," The plot follows Robin Hood as he becomes an outlaw after a conflict with foresters and through his many adventures and run-ins with the law. Each chapter tells a different tale of Robin as he recruits Merry Men, resists the authorities, and aids his fellow man. The popular stories of Little John defeating Robin in a fight with staffs, of Robin's besting at the hands of Friar Tuck, and of his collusion with Alan-a-Dale all appear. In the end, Robin and his men are pardoned by King Richard the Lionheart and his band are incorporated into the king's retinue, much to the dismay of the Sheriff of Nottingham.

The Cask of Amontillado," Montresor tells the story of the day that he took his revenge on Fortunato, a fellow nobleman, to an unspecified person who knows him very well. Angry over some unspecified insult, he plots to murder his friend during Carnival when the man is drunk, dizzy, and wearing a jester's motley. He baits Fortunato by telling him he has obtained what he believes to be a pipe (about 130 gallons, 492 litres) of a rare vintage of Amontillado. He claims he wants his friend's expert opinion on the subject. Fortunato goes with Montresor to the wine cellars of the latter's palazzo, where they wander in the catacombs. Montresor offers wine (first Medoc, then De Grave) to Fortunato. At one point, Fortunato makes an elaborate, grotesque gesture with an upraised wine bottle. When Montresor appears not to recognize the gesture, Fortunato asks, ""You are not of the masons?"" Montresor says he is, and when Fortunato, disbelieving, requests a sign, Montresor displays a trowel he had been hiding. Montresor warns Fortunato, who has a bad cough, of the damp, and suggests they go back; Fortunato insists on continuing, claiming that ""[he] shall not die of a cough."" During their walk, Montresor mentions his family coat of arms: a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot's heel, with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit (""No one insults me with impunity""). When they come to a niche, Montresor tells his victim that the Amontillado is within. Fortunato enters and, drunk and unsuspecting, does not resist as Montresor quickly chains him to the wall. Montresor then declares that, since Fortunato won't go back, he must ""positively leave [him]"". Montresor walls up the niche, entombing his friend alive. At first, Fortunato, who sobers up faster than Montresor anticipated he would, shakes the chains, trying to escape. Fortunato then screams for help, but Montresor mocks his cries, knowing nobody can hear them. Fortunato laughs weakly and tries to pretend that he is the subject of a joke and that people will be waiting for him (including the Lady Fortunato). As the murderer finishes the topmost row of stones, Fortunato wails, ""For the love of God, Montresor!"" Montresor replies, ""Yes, for the love of God!"" He listens for a reply but hears only the jester's bells ringing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a burning torch through the gap. He claims that he feels sick at heart, but dismisses this reaction as an effect of the dampness of the catacombs. In the last few sentences, Montresor reveals that in the 50 years since that night, he has never been caught, and Fortunato's body still hangs from its chains in the niche where he left it. The murderer concludes: Requiescat In Pace! (""May he rest in peace!"").
","The Cask of Amontillado by Edgar Allan Poe The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he venture upon insult, I vowed revenge . A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser . ""Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon,"" says Fortunato . ""You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed,"" he says . ""The Montresors,"" I replied, ""I forget your arms,"" ""the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel"" ""You are not of the brotherhood,"" he replied . ""You? Impossible! A mason?"" he said, ""Yes, yes."" ""It is this,"" I answered, replacing the tool beneath the folds of the cloak . ""The Amontillado!"" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment . With the help of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche . I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had worn off . I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier . I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in . It was succeeded by a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head .

Pandora," Pandora was born with the name Lydia in the Roman Republic in the year 15 BC to a Senatorial family. She is tall, with rippling brown hair and gold-brown eyes. Like many Patrician Roman females of the time Pandora was taught how to read and write and is well versed in epic poems, especially Ovid's works. She meets Marius for the first time when he is twenty-five and she is ten. Marius asks for Lydia's hand in marriage, but her father rejects Marius' offer. Five years later, Lydia sees Marius at a festival and begs her father to allow her to marry Marius. Her father again refuses. Pandora's father holds a high rank as a Senator. But when a new emperor takes power, her family is betrayed by her own brother and killed. Only Pandora and her traitorous brother survive the massacre, and she is taken to Antioch (after changing her name) by a man who was very close to her father. There she meets Marius again, twenty years after their last encounter. Unbeknownst to her, Marius is now a vampire. She eventually finds out what Marius has become, and also that he protects and hides the Queen and King of all Vampires. The vampire, Akabar, wants to steal the Queen's powerful and ancient blood. Marius and Pandora try to prevent him from carrying out his plan. To gain access to the Queen, Akabar uses Marius's love for Pandora against him and drains Pandora to the point of death. In order to save her, Marius is forced to make Pandora into a vampire and forced to let Akabar see the Queen, who then destroys Akabar. The pair stay together for the next two hundred years, taking care of the King and Queen of all vampires, before arguing and separating. Marius later characterized the breakup (of which he left her and she spent six months or more waiting for him to return) as being entirely his fault: He considers himself a teacher who longs to impart what he knows upon his pupils, but Pandora -being as free-spirited and highly educated as she was -had no patience to be his student. During their time together, against his objection, she did turn one of her beloved slaves into a vampire. As soon as he was turned he left the pair and was not seen again. The next time they meet again is in a Dresden ballroom in the early to late-17th century. Marius tries in vain to make Pandora leave her companion and fledgling, Arjun, and come back to him. Pandora's relationship with Arjun is of great concern to Marius, who fears Pandora is being held against her will. While she outwardly denies this, Pandora overcomes her embarrassment and admits to David in her writing that she could not bring herself to leave Arjun, citing that his stronger will propelled them both through time. The next and last time that they meet is in 1985, when she is among thirteen vampires who survived Akasha's killing spree and gathered at Maharet's house in the Sonoma compound to battle against Akasha. Pandora remains quiet and withdrawn throughout the whole ordeal, staring out the windows and saying little, rousing herself only once to say that Akasha is trying to justify deplorable ""reasons"" for a holocaust. Like many vampires, Pandora is a morose, despairing immortal who initially wanted immortality but soon regretted her choice and turns into a dark, indifferent cynic. Lestat thinks that Pandora was troubled in some deep, fundamental way even before she became a vampire, because she's the only vampire who doesn't receive visions of Maharet and Mekare in her dreams. During the confrontation in Sonoma, when Akasha directly asks Pandora to join with her or die, Pandora merely responds in a quiet, indifferent voice that she can't do what Akasha is asking of her, and stoically accepts the idea of being killed. Even after Akasha herself is destroyed and the thirteen vampires regroup in Armand's Night Island in Florida, Pandora still acts withdrawn from her fellow vampire kin, watching music videos all day long and completely ignoring Marius, who dotes on her lovingly. There is no sense of recovery or security in her as there is with the other vampires, and she departs from Night Island alone, still just as morose as ever. David Talbot encounters her in Paris shortly after the events of Memnoch the Devil and before the story of The Vampire Armand. He asks her to write the story of her life, which she does in a cafe by writing in some notebooks he gave her. She recalls the details of her life before becoming a vampire and briefly discusses the period when she was with Marius. After she has finished, she writes that she plans to go to New Orleans to look for Marius and to look into the eyes of Lestat, and try to understand what it is he saw. She is last seen at the end of Blood and Gold, alongside Marius. es:Pandora (novela) fr:Pandora (roman) hr:Pandora (vampir) it:Pandora (romanzo) pl:Pandora (powieść) pt:Pandora (livro) ru:Пандора (роман)

Title: Pandora Author: Henry James Release Date: February 1, 2015 [eBook #2299] Count Vogelstein was a stiff conservative, a Junker of Junkers; he thought modern democracy a temporary phase and expected to find many arguments against it in the great Republic . He was still young enough in diplomacy to think it necessary to have opinions . Count Vogelstein had known in Dresden an American family in which there were three daughters who used to skate with the officers, and some of the ladies now coming on board struck him as of that same habit . At last the ship began to creak and slowly bridge, and the delay at Southampton came to an end . The American coast also might be pretty—he hardly knew what one would expect of an American coast; but was sure it would be different . Count Vogelstein had omitted every pictured plea for his rank; there were others of which he might have made use of . This time there can be no doubt: it was modesty that caused the secretary of legation to turn this portion of his seat outward, away from the eyes of his companions . Vogelstein had noticed her among the people on the wharf at Southampton . She was soon aware he had observed her; whereupon she began to move along the deck with a step that seemed to indicate a purpose of approaching him . But the present specimen was no longer looking at him, and although she passed near him it was now clear she had come above but to take a general survey . Count Otto Vogelstein acquitted herself of the story with perfect simplicity and self-possession . He looked at a flighty forward girl who plants herself in front of a young man in the garden of an hotel . She coloured slightly, but smiled and read his name, while Vogelstein raised his hat . Count Vogelstein had a mother, it appeared, and so had this young lady . he noticed a young man in a high hat and a white overcoat who seemed united to Miss Day by this natural tie . This reflexions would indicate that he read his volume of Tauchnitz rather interruptedly. Mrs. Dangerfield made it known to Count Otto that every morning after breakfast, the hour at which he wrote his journal in his cabin, the old couple were guided upstairs and installed in their customary corner by Pandora . Mr. and Mrs. Day had a white face, large cheeks and small eyes, and her lips moved as if she had always a lozenge in her mouth . Pandora Day was remarkably fine, and day after day it was possible to sit there under the salt sky and feel one’s self rounding the great curves of the globe . The long deck made a white spot in the sharp black circle of the ocean and in the intense sea-light, while the shadow of the smoke-streamers trembled on the familiar floor . Vogelstein was referred to as regards disputed points, and his opinion carried the day . He took little part in the conversation, usually much relaxed, that prevailed in the smoking-room, but from time to time he made, in his soft flat youthful voice, a remark which every one paused to listen to and was greeted with roars of laughter . Mrs. Dangerfield struck and sustained that note, which resounded in the young man’s imagination . In America, when one committed one’s self, there was nothing to do but march to the altar . There appeared to be a constant danger of marrying the American girl, it was something one had to reckon with . Mr. and Mrs. Day looked up at the high functionary who thus unbent to them with very little change of countenance; then looked at each other in the same way . Pandora shook her head, she seemed to be answering for them . It was in the course of the evening after the scene with the Captain that he joined her, awkwardly, abruptly, irresistibly, on the deck . Pandora Day asked if Utica were the seat of her family, if it were important or typical place . Pandora said she wanted to show her little sister everything while she was comparatively unformed . ""I suppose Utica is inferior. It isn’t supreme—that’s what’s the matter with it, and I hate anything middling,"" she said . ""What big expressions you use! Do you think everybody in the world has a social position? That’s reserved for an infinitely small majority of mankind,"" Vogelstein said . ""Oh dear, she isn’t of the lower class,"" Mrs. Dangerfield returned with an irritated sense of wasted wisdom . Mr. and Mrs. Day were seated side by side upon a trunk and encompassed apparently by the accumulations of their tour . They expressed more consciousness of surrounding objects than he had hitherto recognised, and there was an air of placid expansion in the mysterious couple . Count Otto sent off his servant with a porter and followed Pandora Day . ""I guess she has gone to meet that gentleman; he’s a great friend of hers,"" he said . But as he turned away he wondered about the towns of the interior . Pandora shook hands with Count Vogelstein . ""I hope you’ll get through all right,"" she replied, smiling and idiomatic . In a moment Count Otto began his career in America by discussing the tariff of hackney-coaches in the language of the fatherland . At the end of two winters he had naturally had a good many of various kinds—his study of American society had yielded considerable fruit . In April, during the second year of his residence, he presented himself at a large party given by Mrs. Bonnycastle . American promiscuity, goodness knew, had been strange to him, but it was nothing to the queerness of American criticism . Mrs. Bonnycastle had a fund of good humour which was apt to come uppermost with the April blossoms and which made the people she didn’t invite to her house almost as amusing to her as those she did . The couple had that burdensome heritage of foreign reminiscence with which so many Americans were saddled . Mr. Bonnycastle's whimsical suggestion of inviting him in carnival was made . Count Otto had the advantage of seeing an electoral campaign, a presidential inauguration and a distribution of spoils during the first eighteen months . Count Otto knew every one or almost every one . It was a society in which familiarity reigned and in which people were liable to meet three times a day . He had so repeatedly heard himself addressed in even more than triple simultaneity . Count Vogelstein wanted to know what was the social position of Mrs. Steuben . He immediately became aware that he oughtn’t so to have expressed himself . If he were to meet her again she became as vivid in his mind as if they had parted the day before . Count Otto had been long enough in America to discover that after half a century of social neglect Washington had become the fashion and enjoyed the great advantage of being a new resource in conversation . Vogelstein originally had been rather out of step with them, hadn’t known with what they compared this object of their infatuation . Count Otto turned away and pretended to be looking for a cup of tea . He recognised her without her appearing to see him, and even with half an eye, had taken in that she was now a person to be reckoned with . Count Otto drank his tea and as; he put down his cup heard the President, behind him, say: “Well, she doesn’t go out much. Then she has got her sister staying with her.” “She must be a very kind woman,” Pandora replied . “I should bid good-bye to these bright folks,” Vogelstein said . ""Why she’s the new type? _What_ new type, Mrs. Bonnycastle?"" he returned pleadingly—so conscious was he that all types in America were new . Pandora Day had been re-enforced by a gentleman who had held an important place in the cabinet of the late occupant of the presidential chair . Miss Day's companions had various things to say to her before giving her up . She was the widow of a commodore, was a handsome mild soft swaying person . He turned away a little and while Mrs. Steuben waited put her a question . Pandora gave her hand to Count Otto and asked him if he thought they should meet again . Mrs. Steuben remarked that in Washington people were always meeting again and that at any rate he shouldn’t fail to wait upon her . ""What we often take to be the new is simply the old under some novel form,"" Vogelstein said . Alfred Bonnycastle took pity on the self-made girl . ""My dear Vogelstein, she’s the latest freshest fruit of our great American evolution,"" Count Otto said . In the second place she isn’t Self-made at all. We all help to make her,"" he said. the self-made girl was not fast, nor emancipated, nor crude, nor loud, and there wasn’t in her, of necessity at least, a grain of the stuff of which the adventuress is made . she had grasped it by honest exertion, but chiefly, infallibly, by the appearance of her parents . her attitude with regard to them might vary in different ways, he says . Pandora Day was the journey to Europe, the culture (as exemplified in the books she read on the ship), the effacement, of the family . it took all her cleverness to account for such things; for the jump she had taken since he left her in the hands of Mr. Lansing struck Vogelstein . Pandora was greatly interested; she thought the Capitol very fine; it was easy to criticise the details, but as a whole it was the most impressive building she had ever seen . Pandora asked Count Otto if he had ever been to Athens and, on his admitting so much, sought to know whether the eminence on which they stood didn’t give him an idea of the Acropolis in its prime . He turned over these questions in spite of his security, or perhaps indeed because of it . The security made them speculative and disinterested . They haunted him during the excursion to Mount Vernon, which took place according to traditions long established . Count Otto was able to joke a little on great occasions, and the present one was worthy of his humour . He maintained to his companion that the shallow painted mansion resembled a false house, a “wing” or structure of daubed canvas, on the stage; but she answered him so well with certain economical palaces she had seen in Germany . Vogelstein remarked to Pandora that he was a good man for the place, but was too familiar . ""You look as if you could hardly believe that,"" Pandora said . The man with the beard was an ideal minister to American shrines . Count Otto cried with a very becoming blush . ""You are unlike any Mädchen I’ve ever seen—I don’t understand you,"" said poor Vogelstein . It’s known that when the German mind attempts to explain things it doesn’t always reduce them to simplicity, and Pandora was first mystified . ""Oh I mean she’s always engaged to some young man who belongs to her earlier phase,"" Count Otto said . ""I don’t mean anything German and moonstruck. I mean that piece of peculiarly American enterprise a premature engagement, but too complacently, at the end of time,"" Vogelstein reflected . Mr. Bellamy had some business difficulties that made him feel as if he didn’t want to marry just then . But he has given up business and I presume feels more free . Of course it’s rather long, but all the while they’ve been engaged, says Mrs. Steuben . Pandora Day was about forty years old; he had a black moustache and he seemed to look at the world over some counter-like expanse on which he invited it all warily and pleasantly to put down first its idea of the terms of a transaction . Pandora Day drew from his pocket a large letter with an official-looking seal and shook it jocosely above his head . It was a voice close to Count Otto’s shoulder that spoke these words,",0.9867329750248474,0.17798594402811535
Imre: A Memorandum," It was described by the author as ""a little psychological romance"". The narrative follows the lives of two men, who by chance meet at a cafe in Budapest, Hungary. Over the course of several months they forge a friendship that leads to various revelations and disclosures, each of which are carried out with the greatest of subtlety.
","XAVIER MAYNE: In these pages I give you a chapter out of my life . I do not feel so dubious of what may be thought of its utterly sincere course as I did when I began to put it on paper . You know why it has been written at all for you . ""Can one created be--of Nature part-- And ever, ever, trace a track that's false? No... I do not believe it! You have spoken of homosexualism, that profound problem in human nature of old or of to-day; noble or ignoble; outspoken or masked; never to be repressed by a few commonplaces followed between us, as to the band, the programme, the weather . There was a regular dialogue between this fellow-idler and me . From music, we passed to one or another aesthetic question, to literature, to social life, to human emotions . Imre von N..., _hadnagy_ (Lieutenant in the A... Honvéd Regiment, stationed during some years in Szent-Istvánhely, was twenty-five . he was the only son of an old Transylvanian family; one poor now as never before, but evidently lz granderson: Lieutenant Imre von N..... seemed to have his full share of acquaintances . he says he didn't seem to be at all a friend of such demeanour . granderson says if he drew himself back a little, he did not see it at once . Granderson:  ""You have plenty of excellent friends in the world, I perceive,"" says another comrade . ""I must make you a stale sort of answer, to-pardon me,"" he says . He says: ""I infer that your friend is not dead?"" ""Dead? No, no, not that!"" ""I have been dismal ""I beg to compliment on your enthusiasm for your friend... plainly one of the 'real ones' indeed,"" Karvaly says . ""I am not a little stirred by this frank evidence, of a trait that sometimes brings to its possessor about as much melancholy as it does happiness,"" he adds . I have a special sense of the beauty and value of friendship . It often seems a lost emotion, and it is, in some respects, a pity that we don't say it out more . I am an idiot! I beg your pardon! To be talking along--all this personal, sentimental stuff--rubbish Lieutenant Imre von N was a kindly prophecy as to the future of the intimacy, the trust, the decreed progression toward them, even through our--reserves . We met again, in the same place, at the same hour, a few days later; of course, this time by an appointment carefully and gladly kept . Imre von N was a member of the Szent-Istvánhely regiment . he and I met in Sarajevo for the first time in three years . He says there is neither wisdom nor pleasure in wearing one's heart . ""The lie that is half a truth is ever"" a new friend and I had an interesting range of commonplace and practical topics . In my far home, a fair belief is found, That double, by the Gods, each human soul Created is... and once so shaped, divided . I had been longtime enthusiastic as to Hungary and the Hungarians, the land, the race, the magnificent rpád the Great, the Seventh Symphony, and the theory of Bisexual Languages . I think that in those first ten days of our intercourse we touched on, I should say, a hundred subjects . No, one never was at a loss for a topic when with Imre, and one never tired of his talk about it Lieutenant Imre was a soldier in Szent-Istvánhely . he was determined not to be a man of moods to the cynical world's eyes, he says . Imre had a sense of his personal duty, his pride, his filial affection, his feeling toward his King . Imre possessed a slender figure, faultless in proportions, a wonder of muscular development, of strength, lightness and elegance . he was among the crack gymnasts, vaulters and swimmers . I have seen him, often, spring out of a common barrel into another one placed beside it . ""I shall be bald as a cannon-shot by the time I am thirty!"" Imre von N... was a striking example of contradictions and inequations . He had studied hardest when in his school-courses just what came easiest . Imre was a Magyar, one of a race in which sentimental eloquence is always lurking in the blood, he writes . he says Imre had his full share of Magyarism of temperament, and of its impromptu . Imre's aversion to belles-lettres Lieutenant Imre von N.... had no relish for the stupid-smutty sallies and stock _racontars_ of the officers' mess and the barracks . he was a most excellent practical musician; playing the piano-forte superbly well, as to general effect, with an amazingly bad technic of his own evolution . ""Remarkably little"" I say, because of Imre's own frank references to one matter, on our first meeting . I am belated, I see, in alluding to two traits in our acquaintance, _ab initio,_ which are of significance in my outline . ""I have tried to cultivate cheerfulness on Imre von N... was referred to as a wholesale enemy to the peace of heart and to the virtue of dozens of fair citizenesses of Szent-Istvánhely . he admired, and had a circle of admiring, women-friends enough to dismiss at once such an ungallant accusation . ""You are of the opinion that most people... women... men... sculptors, for instance, or painters... ought to be of your opinion?"" ""You do not need to put me on oath, such a newcomer, too, into your society, to give you the conviction,"" Imre replied . ""I most certainly think you  ""I hate... I absolutely hate... to write letters, even to my nearest friends"", Imre protested . ""By God, you have spoken the truth! Yes, to the dot on the _i_!"" Imre could open himself to me thereon, or not at all, he said . I was not curious, nor a pur ""I am here and well. How are you. We are very busy. I saw your cousin, Csodaszép Kisasszony yesterday. No time to-day for more! I simply cannot squeeze _that_ out, or in. Nobody need expect it from your most obedient servant!"" ""Perhaps,"" ass I was struck with the passionate note in Imre's friendship for the absentee, Karvaly Mihály . I swore to myself that I had _no_ right! Even if I..... But there! I bowed . Here Imre took on a most disagreeable sneer. ""Ah, ""Did I ever know such a man... _person_... yourself... in your own circle of friends?"" I laughed, not in mirth, not contempt, but in sheer bitterness of retrospect . ""I didn't allow myself to be too much stirred up by... that remarkably queer one,"" Imre von N... replied  Imre laughed out, too, as if in angry derision . He was absolutely _bódult_ over your humble servant, Szent-Istvánhely . ""I have no use for that particular brand of fool!"" ""My whole life was a contest since the day That gave me being, gave me that which marred The gift,"" he said . The family is a broken and dispersed one . It has its legends, plentifully . Count Z... was shot, standing by his friend's grave... in which he too eventually was buried  Lieutenant Imre and I had been out there once before, with the more freedom because a certain family-connection existed between the Z--s and the N--S . I was superstitiously... irresistibly oppressed with the idea that some disagreeable thing was coming my way . To myself, I accounted for the mood as simple reaction Imre von N... was a man--strong-willed, firm of temper and character . I felt fierce a hatred at this interrupting of a casual, pleasant but not extraordinary intimacy . Why did existence itself seem so ironical, so full of false notes, so capricious in its kindness? ""I don't at all envy you your philosophy, my dear friend,"" he says . ""I think I'd rather not become a stoic. Stoic means a stock."" ""The devil take the little rascal! And the devil takes everything else!"" ""We mustn't let the tragedy spoil our last afternoon,"" a man can remedy a good deal that he feels is an ""insincere"" attitude toward daily life . a soldier may never have loved the wife to whom he is bound, he may never be able to love her . the soldier may find her presence lamentably _unsympathisch. ""You must go on! You have no right to falter now. For God's sake, N.....! put by all these miserable dreams of quitting the service? You have plenty of time for entertaining yourself with strumming and singing, and what not . If you care for your own credit, success... stop, I forbid you to sneer... I confess I don't see now just why. You are a strange fellow, Imre. Such a row of contradictions! I could not recover either. We had made a detour around the lonelier portion of the park, wide, and uncropped save by two cows and a couple of farm-horses . ""We must not expect too much of one another in this world... must we?"" Imre von N: ""I've not remarked them so far! Your heart is not so difficult to please as mine"" Imre vom N: I'm not afraid of committing himself outwardly to some innermost process of thought . ""I am not easy... how I have had to learn the way to keep myself so--to study it till it is a second nature to me!"" Oswald says: ""You seem to forget sometimes that I am a man. Not either of us a--woman. Forgive me. We are both of us, you and I, a bit ""I wish you to listen to me! It is out of one man's deepest yet daily life... my own life,"" says Oswald . ""I am tired of thinking of it. It is time you knew,"" ""I will hear you patiently"" ""You are immediately concerned. That is to say, before it ends. You will see how,"" he ""From the time when I was a lad, Imre... a little child... I felt myself unlike other boys in one element of my nature,"" says Oswald . ""I hid it, at least so far as, little by little, I came to realize its force,"" he says . I had plenty of pluck and muscle, and was ""I knew clearly what it was to _love_ thus, so as to forget oneself in another's life and death!"" I knew that now! I had read it in the verses or the prose of the Greek and Latin and Oriental authours . I was that anachronism from old--that incomprehensible incident in God in every feature and line, we walk the world's ways as men, with vigour, success, honour... _one_ master-instinct unsuspected by society for, it may be, our lives long! We plough the globe's roughest seas as men; we rule its States as men . We fill its gravest profession if love is to be only what the narrow, modern, Jewish-Christian ethics declare it, then is the flouting world quite right! For then we are indeed _not_ men! But if not so, what are we? Answer that, who can! The more perplexed I became because so often in books, old ones or new, n ""We must be judged by our commoner mass,"" says Imre, who had not spoken so much as a word . I paused, a man shuddered before himself as monster, solitary being, leprous, gangrened . ""You must not think that I had not had friendships of much depth, Imre ""How I dreaded, yet sought that Type! ... how soon was I relieved, or dull of heart,"" says Platen . ""I feared... that some one might embody it for me!"" ""O, weh Dir, der die Welt verachtet, allein zu sein"" ""I could say to myself--remember that episode of my ""I was popular enough with women of all sorts. I was no woman-hater. I had many true and charming and most affectionate friendships with women"" ""I paid my distinguished specialist his fee and came away, with a far lighter heart than I had had in many a year,"" he says . ""I am to understand that I am curable? ""I had known a long while earlier that I was loved,"" says Imre . In ten days, Imre, I was betrothed. Do not be surprised . Imre was the daughter of a valued family friend, living in a near town . ""My peace was gone--if ever I had had true peace. I was lost, with it!"" ""From that night, I forgot everything else except him. My former, unchanged, unchangeable self, in all its misery and mystery reverted,"" he says . ""I won his friendship! I did not deceive myself once, either as to ""I was a man perfectly male, save in the one thing which keeps such a 'man' back from possibility of ever becoming integrally male . I was created as a complete human being, of firm, perfect physical and mental health, but in spite of that, a being who from birth was of a vague, special sex; a I learned of the theories of 'secondary sexes' and 'intersex' I could inform myself fully of its mystery, and of the logical, inevitable and necessary place in sexualism . I realized that I had always been a member of that hidden brotherhood and Sub-Sex . So I discovered pretexts to excuse meetings ""I sacrificed the good-will and the longtime intimacy of the others,"" he says . ""The world well lost!' thought I."" ""One holiday, he happened to visit some friends in the town where was living my betrothed"" ""He defended me instantly and warmly. He would be glad to know, now, on what ground ""Did I ask too much? By the God that made mankind, Imre--that made it not only male or female but also as We are... I do not think I did!"" ""You chose me for your friend because you believed me... stay, I will not say _that!_... because you wished me to be... a something else, ""For so began those interminable, those restless pilgrimages, with no set goals for me"" ""My wandering and wandering, ever striving to forget, ever struggling to be beguiled intellectually at least,"" he says . ""For such a miracle of miracles I should not hope, even traversing all the devious ways of life may ""I have been haunted by it; however suppressed in my heart,"" says the poet . ""I had sworn, Imre; and I have kept my word!"" ""I may find myself even half-way drawn to a man by the inner passion of an Uranian love, not by the mere friendship of a colder psychic complexion"" ""I must be taken as I am, or neither pardoned for what I am,"" he says . Fate also has willed that thou wast ordained to come into the world that I should love thee, no matter what thy race... that I believe! But, see! ""I love this world now only because t ""If I could... my God! if I only could!.. say to thee what I cannot. Perhaps... some time... Forgive me, but thou breakest my heart!... Not because I care less for thee as my friend... No, above all else, not that reason! We stay together, Oswald!... We shall always be ""I will look in on you tomorrow... about ten o'clock. I don't start till past midday,"" Imre said . I was no longer disturbed by any mortal concerns, not even by the sense of the coming sundering . In fact the stars, it seemed to me, could shine their clearest in Szent-Is I have a great deal to say to you this evening that I really cannot write . Dear Oswald, you do not know how I value your friendship . I send my this in a spare moment, but I have nothing whatsoever to say . Imre von N... had a stroke under the commonplace words ""Yours ever"" in tenor . ""I am not yet on my homeward-journey. Save your postal artillery,"" Imre replied . I have known what it is to suffer, just because there has been no man to whom I could speak or write . I was busy with my English letters to Imre von N . ""Dear Imre, I am immeasurably happy"", he replied . I stopped to have a bath at the Officers' Baths . a great and profoundly human poet speaks of those emotions that come to us when we are watching, in his sleep, a human being that we love be beautiful . Such moments are indeed likely to be subduing to many a sensitive man and woman . They bring before our eyes the effect of a living statue; a beauty self-unconscious, almost ""God bless thee, Imre!"" my heart exclaimed in benediction . ""I shall never ask of God... of Fate... anything more... save that the gift endure till we two endure not!"" I realized that _those_ days of Solitude were now no longer of any special tyranny upon my moods . I am ""I have not been fair to you, not honest,"" Oswald says . ""I had no complaint against you, dear Imre."" ""No, I have much against myself. You have thought me cold, reserved, abrupt... a fantastic sort of friend to you,"" he tells me . O'wald, for God's sake, does not care I struggled in shame and despair to keep down the hateful physical passion which was making nothing of all my psychic loyalty . I thrust Imre from me--falling away from him, escaping from his side--knowing that just in his surprise at my abruptness, I must meet--his detection of my miserable weakness! All was over! He knew me ""I will go from you. I will go to the other end of the world,"" Imre says . ""I have tried to change myself... to care for you only with my soul. But I cannot change."" ""I am just as art thou... I am? I do not understand!"" ""Look into thyself, Oswald! It is all ""I have known it all, but that is not the whole of my likeness to thee, Oswald! ... I have endured that cruellest of torments for us,"" he says . He paused as if the memory was indeed wormwood, he said . he wished in those moments to think only of ""C'est Venus, tout entière à sa proie attachée"": Imre had never been a weakling, an effeminate lad, nor cared for the society of the girls about him on the playground or in the house . he says Imre's youth had been, indeed, one long and lamentable obsession eric liu: Imre had been on the point of suicide . he says he had grown to have a horror of similisexual types, of all contacts with them . He says it was as destructive of Imre's peace as it was hopeless . but it was impossible of confession to its object, he writes . dread of Karvaly's detection, the struggle with himself to subdue passion, had put Imre, little by little, into a sort of panic . He vowed indifference to the whole world, he assisted no advances of warm, particular regard from any comrade . The cruel irony of it was often almost humorous ""I have never had any intimacies... Merely semblances of such,"" says Oswald . ""You wonder and you blame me,"" Imre replied, after busying himself a few seconds with his own perplexing thoughts .

A Tramp Abroad," The first half of the book covers their stay in south-western Germany (Heidelberg, Mannheim, a trip on the Neckar river, Baden-Baden and the Black Forest). The second part describes his travels through Switzerland and eastern France (Lucerne, Interlaken, Zermatt, Chamonix and Geneva). The end of the book covers his trip through several cities in northern Italy (Milan, Venice and Rome). Several other cities are touched and described during their travels, as well as mountains such as Matterhorn, the Jungfrau, the Rigi-Kulm and Mont-Blanc. Interleaved with the narration, Mark Twain inserted also stories not related to the trip, such as Bluejay Yarn, The Man who puts up at Gasby's and others; as well as many German Legends, partly invented by the author himself. Six Appendices are included in the book. They are short essays dedicated to different topics. The role of The Portier in European hotels and how they make their living, a description of Heidelberg Castle, an essay on College Prisons in Germany, The Awful German Language, a humorous essay on German language, a short story called The legend of the Castle and finally a satirical description of German Newspapers.

The Time Machine," The book's protagonist is an English scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller. The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension, and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator. In the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to 802,701 A.D., where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline, and he speculates that they are a peaceful communist society, the result of humanity conquering nature with technology, and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival. Returning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing, and eventually works out that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Within their dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutish light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing either species, they have both lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of Man at its peak. Meanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he fears he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes only when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena is presumably lost in the fire, as are the Morlocks. The Morlocks use the time machine as bait to ensnare the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth, menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out. Overwhelmed, he returns to his laboratory, arriving just three hours after he originally left. Interrupting dinner, he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange flowers Weena had put in his pocket. The original narrator takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him in final preparations for another journey. The Traveller promises to return in half an hour, but three years later, the narrator despairs of ever learning what became of him.

""You must follow me carefully. I shall have to “I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor . He lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words . “I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a popular scientific “You can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move in Time,” said the Time Traveller . “I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.” “Not exactly,” said The Medical Man. “But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequal The Time Traveller drew up a chair, and sat down, and set it in front of the fire . The Psychologist looked at us, and then at the mechanism . It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions Time Traveller was retorted by the Medical Man . He said: “I want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no ""I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled through this time,"" said the Time Traveller . ""I think. _You_ can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold, you know, diluted presentation,"" remarked the Provincial The Time Traveller Returns I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine . Filby was one of those men who are too clever to be believed . We should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand him . Time Traveller was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise . He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyer . The Editor filled a glass of champagne The Time Traveller came back to the place reserved for him without a word . He pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with his fingernail . ""What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!"" cried the Editor . The Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp . The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the time Traveller through his eyelashes . He drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness . “I suppose I must apologise,” the Editor said  Time Machines began its career at ten o’clock today . The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter . Tomorrow night came black, then night again, day again, faster and faster still . I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars . I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams . The whole surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes . But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in Insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerves . I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith . A pitiless hail was his I was seized with a panic fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it . I felt naked in a strange world, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop . My courage recovered with this recovery of a prompt retreat . V. In the Golden Age, he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes . Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue . It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them . But I made a sudden The Time Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons . I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals . My general impression of the world I saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers  windows, partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light . Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone . Some I recognised as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they were strange . I was constantly meeting more of these men of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in friendly way, leave me again to my own devices . The Sunset of Mankind was a queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was their lack of interest . I realised that there were no small houses to be seen . Here and there were palace-like buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features of our own English landscape, had disappeared . Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each We improve our favourite plants and animals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding . Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can . The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived . But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change . The Time Machine was gone . It was the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay . The time machine was gone, and the time machine is gone! VII. A Sudden Shock . I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby . I ran round it furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair . The attachment of the levers—I will show you the method 'Where is my Time Machine?' I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon them and shaking them up together . When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear . For, I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces . I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet . It was highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side . This directed my closer attention to the pedestal . I was too restless to watch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil . To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless . Face this world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning . a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival . From every hill I climbed I saw the same abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens and the same blossom-laden trees and tree fern I was sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort . But save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I can convey very little of the difference to your mind . I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure . The thing puzzled me a queer friendship lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you . She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. Darkness to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me thinking and observing . To enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension . I never found one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark  Weena's rescue drove them out of his head . It may be that the sun was hotter than our own was the weather of this Golden Age . But people, unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the planets must ultimately fall back into the parent body . I saw a small, white, moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated . I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft . Then the light burned my fingers and fell out There was a tendency to utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation . The presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes showed how universal were its ramifications . the notion was so plausible that I at once accepted it and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of the human species . aristocracy, armed with a perfected science, worked to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today . The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind . It had been no such triumph of moral education and general co-operation as I had imagined . I saw a real IX. The Morlocks: I felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies . They were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum . It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last The descent was effected by metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well . I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her . After that experience, I went on clambering down sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible . I saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the light . So soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest I shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly . I determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare . The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness . I lit my last match ... and it incontinently went out . I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks . At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight  The Eloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility . The Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service . Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table . To me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness . In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as declaration of war  The Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore . Only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I had traversed . I thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes . I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness . The Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of . I tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched XI. The Palace of Green Porcelain was deserted and falling into ruin . I was surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been . At the first glance I was reminded of a museum, the tiled floor was thick with dust  The Palontological Section was a very splendid array of fossils it must have been . It had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its force . Here and there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon I fancied that if I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks . As you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit like the ‘area’ of a London house before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at I longed very much to kill a Morlock or so . It was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things . Only my disinclination to leave Weena restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I heard . I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors . As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon . In another place was a vast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phnician . I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed . It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire . Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them, partly because of the mystery on the other side . In this decadence, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on the earth . The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to Weena . I caught her up, and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood . Overhead it was simply black, except where I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves . Then I turned to where I was sitting beside my iron mace . I tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead  I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck . I struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and for a moment I was free . The whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them . A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement . Upon the hillside were some thirty or forty Morlocks blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment . At first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more  The Trap of the White Sphinx left me absolutely lonely again—terribly alone . I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain . Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage and the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins . The Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness, and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry . But as time went on, the feeding of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed . Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back again  The Morlocks slid up and struck the frame with a clang . I had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost . But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box . It was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I circling of stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light . At one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat . The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock moving slowly towards me . Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature . Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses . I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling . I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea . A shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach . The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little . Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent . The Time Traveller’s Return “So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The Time Traveller looked at the _Pall Mall Gazette_ on the table by the door . The Medical Man said: “No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie—or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand along the damaged rail . I was told he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely . The story was so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober . ""I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room The Time Traveller vanished three years ago . And, as everybody knows now, he has never returned . I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime .

Dawn," 14-year-old Dawn Longchamp leads a humble, rootless existence with her parents, Ormond and Sally Jean Longchamp, and her moody older brother Jimmy, who is 16-years-old. Moving around a lot, Dawn's family does not provide much stability for her, but what her lifestyle lacks in stability, her home life makes up for in love. This erratic lifestyle seems to change when Dawn and Jimmy are able to enroll in an exclusive private school when Ormond gets a job there. It is here that Dawn's talent for singing is discovered. Her brother does not enjoy the school, feeling the weight of class differences bear down upon him. Dawn, although optimistic, does not fare much better, and is sternly ordered by the headmistress to be on her best behavior as she is of lesser social status than her classroom peers. On her first day, she also incurs the wrath of the most popular and affluent girl in the school, Clara Sue Cutler, after accidentally ratting her out on her smoking. Clara Sue then proceeds to pull mean-spirited pranks on Dawn and openly refers to her as white trash. Deeply offended, Dawn finally stops trying to like Clara Sue after this insult. However, Clara Sue's older brother, the handsome and charming Philip Cutler, does not share his sister's loathing. Phillip is kind to Dawn, and immediately shows an interest in her. He compares her beauty to that of his mother, Laura Sue Cutler, and is easily entranced. Jimmy is wary of Phillip, but does not overtly oppose Dawn's involvement with him. A shy girl who has had a sheltered upbringing, Dawn is somewhat taken aback by Phillip's immediate romantic overtures, even though she does find him attractive. Phillip urges her to date him, and after constant persuasion from him, Dawn agrees. Meanwhile, Dawn's mother, Sally Jean, has discovered that she is pregnant. This strains the Longchamps' finances, which are already tight, but Dawn is still overjoyed at the prospect of a little sibling, hoping that the baby will look more like her. Sally Jean gives birth to a little girl named Fern, but does not recover her health after the labor. She attempts several holistic ways of recovering her health but to no avail. She remains bedridden for the duration of Dawn's school year. At school, Dawn is excited by the musical opportunities now opening up to her. Her enjoyment of music culminates in her solo song, Somewhere over the Rainbow, at a school concert. Although nervous because of a prank pulled earlier by Clara Sue and her clique, Dawn draws emotional strength from the pearl necklace Sally Jean gave her earlier in the evening, which she claims are a Longchamp heirloom. Dawn's world comes crashing down after her solo performance at the school concert. Her beloved mother, Sally Jean, passes away that night. With the shock of this barely registered, what comes on the heels of Sally Jean's death truly changes Dawn's life forever. A security guard at the hospital where Sally Jean died recognizes the family, and also notices something peculiar in Dawn's appearance. He goes to the authorities, who perform an early morning raid of the Longchamp residence. Through these officers, it is revealed to Dawn that she is not Ormond and Sally Jean's biological daughter, but that she was kidnapped by them as a newborn baby, and that she is actually the daughter of Randolph and Laura Sue Cutler. Dawn is taken back to Cutler's Cove, Virginia, an offshoot of Virginia Beach. Ormond is arrested for child kidnapping. With no nearby relatives to come to their aid, Jimmy and Fern are placed in foster care. Dawn refuses to believe that Ormond kidnapped her, but the authorities prove her identity through a unique birthmark she shares with the description of the kidnapped baby. Dawn is appalled at the realization that the terrible Clara Sue is her sister; even worse, her boyfriend, Phillip, is actually her brother. These concerns fade into the background after her first meeting with Grandmother Cutler at the family's hotel, also named Cutler's Cove. Grandmother Cutler does not seem overjoyed about the return of her long-lost grandchild. She informs Dawn that she will be known by her ""true"" name, Eugenia, and that she will work in the hotel as a maid in order to prove that she is trustworthy. Dawn is shocked and upset by this cold treatment. She tries appealing to her real parents, Randolph and Laura Sue, but they are just as powerless as her. Randolph, though charming and handsome, has little willpower and prefers life to be as smooth as possible. Laura Sue is enchanted by Dawn's prettiness and resemblance to her, but refuses to make any effort to help her, as she is completely cowed by her mother-in-law. Dawn is also put at risk by Clara Sue's malicious tricks. Infuriated by Dawn's return, she does her best to make sure Dawn is fired by stealing jewellery and other items from the hotel guests. Dawn finds some comfort in the housekeeper, Mrs. Boston, who knew Sally Jean and Ormond Longchamp when they worked at the hotel. She cannot believe that her parents stole her, as they were always honest, hard-working people. Mrs. Boston hints that there is more to the ""kidnapping"" than meets the eye. Dawn's life is further brightened by a secret visit from Jimmy, aided and abetted by Phillip. Jimmy confesses that he has been in love with Dawn since they were children, but never dared show it because he felt he was sick for thinking of her that way. Dawn admits the attraction is mutual, but they find it hard to overcome their upbringing as brother and sister. This happy interlude comes to an end when Clara Sue finds Jimmy in the basement, where Dawn hid him. She tells Grandmother Cutler, who goes to the police and has Jimmy taken back to his foster parents. Dawn is heart-broken that Jimmy has to leave and is furious with Clara Sue. Jealous of her obvious affection for Jimmy, Phillip corners Dawn in her bathroom and rapes her. Desperate to get out, Dawn visits Mrs. Dalton, the woman who took care of her just after she was born, and learns that her ""kidnapping"" was staged by Grandmother Cutler because Randolph was not her biological father, as her mother had extramarital affairs, and didn't want a non-Culter child to receive benefits from the family. The Longchamps were paid with family jewels, including Dawn's pearls, to keep them quiet and to provide for Dawn and Jimmy. Outraged, Dawn confronts Grandmother Cutler about this. The old woman eventually agrees that she was the instigator and makes Dawn a deal: if Dawn will go to a singing school in New York, she will get Ormond out of prison. Dawn agrees but on one condition: that she be referred to by Dawn, not Eugenia. The book ends with Dawn going to New York.

The Return of the Native," The novel takes place entirely in the environs of Egdon Heath, and, with the exception of the epilogue, Aftercourses, covers exactly a year and a day. The narrative begins on the evening of Guy Fawkes Night as Diggory Venn drives slowly across the heath, carrying a hidden passenger in the back of his van. When darkness falls, the country folk light bonfires on the surrounding hills, emphasizing—not for the last time—the pagan spirit of the heath and its denizens. Venn is a reddleman; he travels the country marking flocks of sheep with a red mineral called ""reddle"", a dialect term for red ochre. Although his trade has stained him red from head to foot, underneath his devilish colouring he is a handsome, shrewd, well-meaning young man. His passenger is a young woman named Thomasin Yeobright, whom Venn is taking home. Earlier that day, Thomasin had planned to marry Damon Wildeve, a local innkeeper known for his fickleness; however, a minor change in disposition as regards to Wildeve delayed the marriage. Thomasin, in distress, ran after the reddleman's van and asked him to take her home. Venn himself is in love with Thomasin, and unsuccessfully wooed her a year or two before. Now, although he knows Wildeve is unworthy of her love, he is so devoted to her that he is willing to help her secure the man of her choice. At length, Venn reaches Bloom's End, the home of Thomasin's aunt, Mrs. Yeobright. She is a good woman, if somewhat proud and inflexible, and she wants the best for Thomasin. In former months she opposed her niece's choice of husband, and publicly forbade the banns; now, since Thomasin has compromised herself by leaving town with Wildeve and returning unmarried, the best outcome Mrs. Yeobright can envision is for the postponed marriage to be duly solemnized as soon as possible. She and Venn both begin working on Wildeve to make sure he keeps his promise to Thomasin. Wildeve, however, is still preoccupied with Eustacia Vye, an exotically beautiful young woman living with her grandfather in a lonely house on Egdon Heath. Eustacia is a black-haired, queenly woman who grew up in Budmouth, a fashionable seaside resort. She holds herself aloof from most of the heathfolk; they, in turn, consider her an oddity, and one or two even think she's a witch. She is nothing like Thomasin, who is sweet-natured. She loathes the heath, yet roams it constantly, carrying a spyglass and an hourglass. The previous year, she and Wildeve were lovers; however, even during the height of her passion for him, she knew she only loved him because there was no better object available. When Wildeve broke off the relationship to court Thomasin, Eustacia's interest in him briefly returned. The two meet on Guy Fawkes night, and Wildeve asks her to run off to America with him. She demurs. Eustacia drops Wildeve when Mrs. Yeobright's son Clym, a successful diamond merchant, returns from Paris to his native Egdon Heath. Although he has no plans to return to Paris or the diamond trade and is, in fact, openly planning to become a schoolmaster for the rural poor, Eustacia sees him as a way to escape the hated heath and begin a grander, richer existence in a glamorous new location. With some difficulty, she arranges to meet Clym, and the two soon fall in love. When Mrs. Yeobright objects, Clym quarrels with her; later, she quarrels with Eustacia as well. When he sees that Eustacia is lost to him, Wildeve marries Thomasin, who gives birth to a daughter the next summer. Clym and Eustacia also marry and move to a small cottage five miles away, where they enjoy a brief period of happiness. The seeds of rancour soon begin to germinate, however: Clym studies night and day to prepare for his new career as a schoolmaster while Eustacia clings to the hope that he'll give up the idea and take her abroad. Instead, he nearly blinds himself with too much reading, then further mortifies his wife by deciding to eke out a living, at least temporarily, as a furze-cutter. Eustacia, her dreams blasted, finds herself living in a hut on the heath, chained by marriage to a lowly labouring man. At this point, Wildeve reappears; he has unexpectedly inherited a large sum of money, and is now in a better position to fulfill Eustacia's hopes. He comes calling on the Yeobrights in the middle of one hot August day and, although Clym is at home, he is fast asleep on the hearth after a gruelling session of furze-cutting. While Eustacia and Wildeve are talking, Mrs. Yeobright knocks on the door; she has decided to pay a courtesy call in the hopes of healing the estrangement between herself and her son. Eustacia looks out at her and then, in some alarm, ushers her visitor out the back door. She hears Clym calling to his mother and, thinking his mother's knocking has awakened him, remains in the garden for a few moments. When Eustacia goes back inside, she finds Clym still asleep and his mother gone. Clym, she now realises, merely cried out his mother's name in his sleep. Mrs Yeobright, it turns out, saw Eustacia looking out the window at her; she also saw Clym's gear by the door, and so knew they were both at home. Now, thinking she has been deliberately barred from her son's home, she miserably begins the long, hot walk home. Later that evening, Clym, unaware of her attempted visit, heads for Bloom's End and on the way finds her crumpled beside the path, dying from an adder's bite. When she expires that night from the combined effects of snake venom and heat exhaustion, Clym's grief and remorse make him physically ill for several weeks. Eustacia, racked with guilt, dares not tell him of her role in the tragedy; when he eventually finds out from a neighbour's child about his mother's visit—and Wildeve's—he rushes home to accuse his wife of murder and adultery. Eustacia refuses to explain her actions; instead, she tells him You are no blessing, my husband and reproaches him for his cruelty. She then moves back to her grandfather's house, where she struggles with her despair while she awaits some word from Clym. Wildeve visits her again on Guy Fawkes night, and offers to help her get to Paris. Eustacia realises that if she lets Wildeve help her, she'll be obliged to become his mistress. She tells him she will send him a signal by night if she decides to accept. Clym's anger, meanwhile, has cooled and he sends Eustacia a letter the next day offering reconciliation. The letter arrives a few minutes too late; by the time her grandfather tries to give it to her, she has already signalled to Wildeve and set off through wind and rain to meet him. She walks along weeping, however, knowing she is about to break her marriage vows for a man who is unworthy of her. Wildeve readies a horse and gig and waits for Eustacia in the dark. Thomasin, guessing his plans, sends Clym to intercept him; she also, by chance, encounters Diggory Venn as she dashes across the heath herself in pursuit of her husband. Eustacia does not appear; instead, she falls or throws herself into nearby Shadwater Weir. Clym and Wildeve hear the splash and hurry to investigate. Wildeve plunges recklessly after Eustacia without bothering to remove his coat, while Clym, proceeding more cautiously, nevertheless is also soon at the mercy of the raging waters. Venn arrives in time to save Clym, but is too late for the others. When Clym revives, he accuses himself of murdering his wife and mother. In the epilogue, Venn gives up being a reddleman to become a dairy farmer. Two years later, Thomasin marries him and they settle down happily together. Clym, now a sad, solitary figure, eventually takes up preaching.

The Haunted Bookshop," The narrative begins with a young advertising man, Aubrey Gilbert, stopping by a bookstore named ""The Haunted Bookshop"" in the hopes of finding a new client. Gilbert meets the proprietor, Roger Mifflin. Gilbert does not succeed in selling advertising copy, but is intrigued by Mifflin and his conviction concerning the value books and booksellers have to the world. Additionally, Gilbert is intrigued by the fact that his firm's biggest client, Mr. Chapman, is a friend of Mifflin and has asked Mifflin to undertake the education of his daughter, Titania Chapman, by hiring her on as an assistant. Gilbert returns to the book store, meets Titania, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile mysterious things begin happening: a copy of Thomas Carlyle's Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell disappears and reappears, Gilbert is attacked as he travels home, and a pharmacist neighbor of Mifflin is observed skulking in the alley behind the bookstore at night speaking to someone in German, an assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel has posted an ad in the New York Times promising a reward for a lost copy of Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell. Gilbert starts to sense that something nefarious is afoot and suspects that the gregarious Mifflin is involved in a plot to kidnap Titania, and he assigns himself the job of protecting her. Meanwhile, Mifflin begins to train Titania in the booksellers' trade. His focus is so centered on books and their content that he fails to note the unusual things that are occurring. Gilbert takes a room across from the bookstore in order to keep eye on things, and believes his suspicions confirmed when he sees the pharmacist let himself into the bookshop with his own key late at night. Gilbert breaks into the bookshop in an effort to find evidence to prove his suspicions, but only manages to frighten and anger Titania. Gilbert learns that Mifflin is to take a day trip to Philadelphia, and follows him in the belief that the trip is a part of the ""kidnapping"" plot. In Philadelphia Gilbert confronts Mifflin with his suspicions, telling him of all the things that have occurred. The two realize that a third party had lured Mifflin away from the shop. They call the bookshop and learn that the pharmacist has left a suitcase of books there for someone else to pick up. Mifflin tells Titania to hold onto the case until he returns. Mifflin and Gilbert return to the bookshop and find it locked. Inside, the pharmacist and an associate of his have tied up Mrs. Mifflin and are menacing Titania with a gun. A fight ensues, part of the bookstore is destroyed by a bomb, and the pharmacist escapes. The only casualties of the bomb are the pharmacist's partner and Mifflin's dog, Bock. Mifflin even affects to be pleased as the blast knocked down books he'd forgotten he had. In the final chapter of the book Gilbert and Mifflin learn what the true plot was: The pharmacist was a German spy who had been using the bookshop as a drop-off point. He was a specialist in making bombs, and had hidden a bomb in one of President Woodrow Wilson's favorite books. The pharmacist's co-conspirator was the assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel. He was to be part the crew on the ship Wilson was to travel on to peace talks in Europe, and was to plant the bomb in Wilson's cabin in an assassination plot. The pharmacist was captured by police, and killed himself.

Dawn," 14-year-old Dawn Longchamp leads a humble, rootless existence with her parents, Ormond and Sally Jean Longchamp, and her moody older brother Jimmy, who is 16-years-old. Moving around a lot, Dawn's family does not provide much stability for her, but what her lifestyle lacks in stability, her home life makes up for in love. This erratic lifestyle seems to change when Dawn and Jimmy are able to enroll in an exclusive private school when Ormond gets a job there. It is here that Dawn's talent for singing is discovered. Her brother does not enjoy the school, feeling the weight of class differences bear down upon him. Dawn, although optimistic, does not fare much better, and is sternly ordered by the headmistress to be on her best behavior as she is of lesser social status than her classroom peers. On her first day, she also incurs the wrath of the most popular and affluent girl in the school, Clara Sue Cutler, after accidentally ratting her out on her smoking. Clara Sue then proceeds to pull mean-spirited pranks on Dawn and openly refers to her as white trash. Deeply offended, Dawn finally stops trying to like Clara Sue after this insult. However, Clara Sue's older brother, the handsome and charming Philip Cutler, does not share his sister's loathing. Phillip is kind to Dawn, and immediately shows an interest in her. He compares her beauty to that of his mother, Laura Sue Cutler, and is easily entranced. Jimmy is wary of Phillip, but does not overtly oppose Dawn's involvement with him. A shy girl who has had a sheltered upbringing, Dawn is somewhat taken aback by Phillip's immediate romantic overtures, even though she does find him attractive. Phillip urges her to date him, and after constant persuasion from him, Dawn agrees. Meanwhile, Dawn's mother, Sally Jean, has discovered that she is pregnant. This strains the Longchamps' finances, which are already tight, but Dawn is still overjoyed at the prospect of a little sibling, hoping that the baby will look more like her. Sally Jean gives birth to a little girl named Fern, but does not recover her health after the labor. She attempts several holistic ways of recovering her health but to no avail. She remains bedridden for the duration of Dawn's school year. At school, Dawn is excited by the musical opportunities now opening up to her. Her enjoyment of music culminates in her solo song, Somewhere over the Rainbow, at a school concert. Although nervous because of a prank pulled earlier by Clara Sue and her clique, Dawn draws emotional strength from the pearl necklace Sally Jean gave her earlier in the evening, which she claims are a Longchamp heirloom. Dawn's world comes crashing down after her solo performance at the school concert. Her beloved mother, Sally Jean, passes away that night. With the shock of this barely registered, what comes on the heels of Sally Jean's death truly changes Dawn's life forever. A security guard at the hospital where Sally Jean died recognizes the family, and also notices something peculiar in Dawn's appearance. He goes to the authorities, who perform an early morning raid of the Longchamp residence. Through these officers, it is revealed to Dawn that she is not Ormond and Sally Jean's biological daughter, but that she was kidnapped by them as a newborn baby, and that she is actually the daughter of Randolph and Laura Sue Cutler. Dawn is taken back to Cutler's Cove, Virginia, an offshoot of Virginia Beach. Ormond is arrested for child kidnapping. With no nearby relatives to come to their aid, Jimmy and Fern are placed in foster care. Dawn refuses to believe that Ormond kidnapped her, but the authorities prove her identity through a unique birthmark she shares with the description of the kidnapped baby. Dawn is appalled at the realization that the terrible Clara Sue is her sister; even worse, her boyfriend, Phillip, is actually her brother. These concerns fade into the background after her first meeting with Grandmother Cutler at the family's hotel, also named Cutler's Cove. Grandmother Cutler does not seem overjoyed about the return of her long-lost grandchild. She informs Dawn that she will be known by her ""true"" name, Eugenia, and that she will work in the hotel as a maid in order to prove that she is trustworthy. Dawn is shocked and upset by this cold treatment. She tries appealing to her real parents, Randolph and Laura Sue, but they are just as powerless as her. Randolph, though charming and handsome, has little willpower and prefers life to be as smooth as possible. Laura Sue is enchanted by Dawn's prettiness and resemblance to her, but refuses to make any effort to help her, as she is completely cowed by her mother-in-law. Dawn is also put at risk by Clara Sue's malicious tricks. Infuriated by Dawn's return, she does her best to make sure Dawn is fired by stealing jewellery and other items from the hotel guests. Dawn finds some comfort in the housekeeper, Mrs. Boston, who knew Sally Jean and Ormond Longchamp when they worked at the hotel. She cannot believe that her parents stole her, as they were always honest, hard-working people. Mrs. Boston hints that there is more to the ""kidnapping"" than meets the eye. Dawn's life is further brightened by a secret visit from Jimmy, aided and abetted by Phillip. Jimmy confesses that he has been in love with Dawn since they were children, but never dared show it because he felt he was sick for thinking of her that way. Dawn admits the attraction is mutual, but they find it hard to overcome their upbringing as brother and sister. This happy interlude comes to an end when Clara Sue finds Jimmy in the basement, where Dawn hid him. She tells Grandmother Cutler, who goes to the police and has Jimmy taken back to his foster parents. Dawn is heart-broken that Jimmy has to leave and is furious with Clara Sue. Jealous of her obvious affection for Jimmy, Phillip corners Dawn in her bathroom and rapes her. Desperate to get out, Dawn visits Mrs. Dalton, the woman who took care of her just after she was born, and learns that her ""kidnapping"" was staged by Grandmother Cutler because Randolph was not her biological father, as her mother had extramarital affairs, and didn't want a non-Culter child to receive benefits from the family. The Longchamps were paid with family jewels, including Dawn's pearls, to keep them quiet and to provide for Dawn and Jimmy. Outraged, Dawn confronts Grandmother Cutler about this. The old woman eventually agrees that she was the instigator and makes Dawn a deal: if Dawn will go to a singing school in New York, she will get Ormond out of prison. Dawn agrees but on one condition: that she be referred to by Dawn, not Eugenia. The book ends with Dawn going to New York.

Christine," In 1978, while riding home from work with his friend Dennis, nerdy teen Arnold ""Arnie"" Cunningham spots a dilapidated red and white Plymouth Fury parked in front of a house. Arnie makes Dennis stop so he can examine the car, despite Dennis's attempts to talk Arnie out of it. The car's owner, Roland D. LeBay, an elderly gentleman wearing a back supporter, sells the car—named ""Christine""—to Arnie for $250. While waiting for Arnie to finish the paperwork, Dennis sits inside Christine. He has a vision of the car and the surroundings as they were in 1958, when the car was new. Frightened, Dennis gets out of Christine, deciding he does not like Arnie's new car. Arnie brings Christine to a do-it-yourself auto repair facility run by Will Darnell, who is suspected of using the garage as a front for illicit operations. As Arnie restores the automobile he becomes withdrawn, humorless and cynical, yet more confident and self-assured. Dennis is puzzled by the changes in both his friend and Christine; the repair work proceeds haphazardly, and the more extensive repairs do not appear to be done by Arnie. Arnie's appearance improves in tandem with Christine's. When LeBay dies, Dennis meets his younger brother, George, who reveals Roland's history of violent behavior. George also reveals that LeBay's small daughter choked to death on a hamburger in the back seat of the car, and that LeBay's wife was so traumatized that she apparently committed suicide in its front seat by carbon monoxide poisoning. As time passes, Dennis observes that Arnie is taking on many of LeBay's personality traits. Dennis also notices that Arnie has become close to Darnell, even acting as a courier in Darnell's contraband smuggling operations. When Arnie is almost finished restoring Christine, an attractive girl named Leigh Cabot transfers to his high school. She is regarded as the school beauty, and her decision to go out with Arnie puzzles everyone. While on a date with Arnie, she nearly chokes to death on a hamburger and is saved only by the intervention of a hitchhiker who uses the Heimlich maneuver. Leigh notices that Christine's dashboard lights seemed to become glaring green eyes, watching her during the incident, and that Arnie tried to save her by ineffectually pounding her on the back. She realizes that she and Christine are competing for Arnie's affection, and she vows to never get into that car again. Arnie's mother refuses to let him keep Christine at home. After several arguments, Arnie's father convinces him to purchase a 30 day pass for the airport parking lot, helping to restore peace in the family. Soon afterward, Buddy Repperton, a bully who frequently targeted Arnie before being expelled from high school, and his gang of thugs vandalize the car. As Arnie pushes Christine through Darnell's garage/junkyard, the car repairs itself. Arnie strains his back in the process and begins wearing a brace all the time, as LeBay did. His relationship with Leigh declines. A number of inexplicable car-related deaths occur around town, starting with Buddy and all but one of his accomplices in the vandalism and ending with Will Darnell. The police find evidence linking Christine to the scene of each death, although none is found on the car itself. A police detective named Rudy Junkins becomes suspicious of Arnie, and his suspicions are not allayed even though Arnie is able to produce an airtight alibi for each death. It is revealed that Christine, possessed by LeBay's vengeful spirit, is committing these murders independently and repairing herself after each one. Arnie becomes obsessed with Christine, forgetting Leigh entirely, and Leigh and Dennis begin their own relationship, unearthing details of Christine's and LeBay's past. One evening, Arnie stumbles upon Leigh and Dennis intimately close in Dennis's car, sending him into a rage. Junkins also falls victim to a gruesome death. Knowing they are now at the top of LeBay and Christine's hit list, Dennis and Leigh devise a plan to destroy the car and, hopefully, save Arnie. While Arnie is out of town, they lure Christine to Darnell's garage and batter her to pieces using a septic tanker truck. The remains are put through a car crusher, and Dennis learns that Arnie and his mother were both killed in a highway accident, while Christine killed Arnie's father earlier. Witness accounts lead Dennis to believe that LeBay's spirit, tied to Arnie through Christine, tore itself away and caused the wreck. Four years later, Dennis reflects on these events. He and Leigh parted after attending college together, and he is now a junior high school teacher. He learns about a freak car accident in Los Angeles, in which a movie theater employee - possibly the last surviving member of Buddy's gang - was struck and killed by a car that smashed in through the theater wall. Dennis speculates that Christine may have rebuilt herself and set out to kill everyone who stood against her, saving him for last.

Pour un juge fin de la beauté féminine, Nadéje était loin de méri Axel nomma le comte de Simiane, et tous trois commencèrent à causer debout, près de la cheminée, en ce moment déserte . En voyant rentrer George Georges s'inclina devant la jeune fille et lui tendit la main en souriant; elle y mit la sienne avec une grâce charmante . M. de Simiane jeta un regard furtif Il est vrai que la jeune fille déploya pour se permettre l'allusion même la plus indirecte contre Christine, et M. de Simiane n'était point d'ailleurs homme à la permettre; mais Christine n'était pas couchée; ne l'avait-il pas vue quelques heures auparavant, et la comtesse ni lui avait-elle pas répondu qu'il ny avait point pour lui de Christine oublia, Christine ne se souvint que pour entourer celle qu'il aimait d'attentions plus délicates et de soins plus empressés .

Elle fut effrayée des changements rapides que la douleur avait produits sur  La présence de Maa rendait possibles de plus fréquentes assiduités chez Christine . Le major crut qu'il s'était trop hâté, et il résolut d'être plus patient  Il s'aperçut que Nadéje n'était pas celle qu'il avait rêvée, mais les femmes qui ont de si belles robes font en général plus de plaisir aux autres qu'à leurs maris Mme de Bjorn n'était pas grande et méritait son surnom de _petite baronne_; c'était une blonde piquante; un pote de la cour avait comparé ses yeux à deux Maa n'était point encore désarmée; elle profita, elle abusa peut-être du silence et de l'abattement du jeune homme . ne venait pas aussi jalouse Maa vit bien qu'elle ne réussirait pas à la calmer, dit Christine, c'est ainsi qu'il a dû parler .

Bluebeard," At the opening of the book, the narrator, Rabo Karabekian, apologizes to the arriving guests: ""I promised you an autobiography, but something went wrong in the kitchen..."" He describes himself as a museum guard who answers questions from visitors coming to see his priceless collected art. He shares the lonely home with his live-in cook and her daughter, Celeste. One afternoon, Circe Berman wanders onto Karabekian's private beach. When he reaches out to greet her, she catches him by surprise with the forward statement ""Tell me how your parents died."" He tells her the story and proceeds to invite her back to his home for a drink. After a drink and supper, Karabekian invites her to stay with him, as Paul Slazinger does. After a time, he begins to find her charm ""manipulative"", as she typically gets her way. Mrs. Berman does not respect his abstract art collection, including works by Jackson Pollock. She explores every inch of Karabekian's home, constantly asking him questions. The only place that is off-limits to her is the potato barn. The potato barn is the home of Karabekian's studio and holds his ""secret"". The barn has no windows, and Karabekian has gone through the trouble of nailing one end shut and immobilizing the other with six padlocks. The secret of the potato barn has enticed collectors to make outrageous offers and to raise suspicions of stolen masterpieces. It is to remain locked until after Karabekian passes away.

The books in this series of Bedtime Wonder Tales are made up of favorite stories from the folklore of all nations . a man with a blue beard was so unlucky that the first impulse of every woman and girl he met was to run away from him . In the same vicinity, a lady of quality had two beautiful daughters, and he wished to marry one of them . The lady sighed to think of her children's obstinacy in refusing to become the mistress of such a magnificent mansion . The more she thought about it, the more curious she became . At the door she hesitated, recalling her husband's command, and fearful of his anger; but the temptation was too strong, and she tremblingly opened the door . After all the guests had gone, Fatima noticed a spot of blood on the key of the fatal room . She tried to wipe it off, but the spot remained . ""You shall go in again, madam, but you will never return,"" Bluebeard responds . Poor Fatima hastened to a little turret chamber whither her sister had fled in terror and grief . ""I will give you ten minutes, but not one moment more,"" she says . Then she asks, ""I see nothing but the sun shining and the grass growing tall and green"" Fatima threw herself at her wicked husband's feet, and once again begged him to spare her life . ""Your entreaties are wasted! You shall die!"" Bluebeard seized her by the hair and raised his scimitar to strike . She married a man whose kind treatment helped her forget her unfortunate experience . The son went to a great school and was very industrious and made excellent progress . ""I will go a little deeper into the forest and look for birds' nests,"" the scholar says . ""You will get so weary you will not be able to raise your arm. Keep quiet a bit and sit down here with me,"" he tells a goblin . The scholar snarled with a voice of thunder . ""You are disregarding your own best interests,"" the goblin says . ""No, no, you will only deceive me,"" the scholar declares . Then he says: ""I will release you. See to it that you do as you have promised"" ""You have nothing but what I give you. Some student nonsense is stuck in your head,"" his father says . ""You can go home, but I must keep on with the chopping,"" the son says of the damaged ax . The goldsmith gave him eighty dollars, and the scholar tramped back home . Tom harkened with all his ears, and heard the unhappy creature saying: ""Oh! the stone, the great big stone! Oh! The stone on top!"" Tom was scared, and he disliked to meddle with the thing . It was no bigger than a year old baby, but had a great mass of hair and a heavy beard . The hair and the beard were so long and so twisted round the creature's body . ""I am your friend, Yallery Brown, my lad,"" master says . ""I have no hankering for a wife,"" master tells him . yallery brown's work was better done than Tom himself could do it . Tom was compelled to sit by and look on and have the cold shoulder turned on him . The horrid thing broke into a screeching laugh, and pointed its brown finger at Tom . ""Look here, master, I'll thank you to leave me alone after this,"" Tom yelled . I was where I could do no harm under that stone, Tom, and you let me out . Then it began to curse and call down misfortunes on Tom . It danced round Tom with its yellow hair and beard all flying and a savage scowl on its wrinkled face . There was no end to Tom's spite even until his life ended . a little jackal snatched out his paw and ran up the bank and into the jungle . The alligator was furiously angry, but if he gets hold of him again he will not escape so easily . He was afraid, and stayed in the woods living on figs that he gathered under a wild fig tree . When he went nearer he became suspicious, and thought, ""I will just shake myself and make the fig ... roll The little jackal was terribly frightened when the alligator came to his house . He hid under the heap of dead leaves and piled it against the doorway . Then the little creature called loudly: ""I shall have to speak just as the house would speak"" Then he asked: ""What is the matter, house of mine?"" Channa, their sister, went to the ogre's house in the wood . After the brothers had been gone from home a long time, they begged him to give them something to eat . They told her to stay quietly in their part of the house so they wouldn't be aware of her presence . Then they left a little basket of peas to cook . ""Heaven keep me from bringing such a misfortune on you!"" Channa exclaimed . They took possession of all the ogre's goods, made themselves masters of the whole house . In a few minutes she rejoined the pilgrim and bound the plaster on his head . ""Hear then what you must do,"" the whale said . ""I will gladly do that for you,"" Channa says . At length she came to a river and followed it up to its source in a beautiful open country of meadows starred with flowers . When she got to it she sat down on a stone to rest . X--TIME AND HIS MOTHER When the pilgrim finished speaking, Channa climbed the mountain and arrived in the vicinity of the castle . He was an old man with a long beard, he carried a scythe, and he had large wings that bore him swiftly out of sight . She hastened to seize the weights of the clock and tell her what she wanted to know . The ants will live a hundred years if they will dispense with flying . The whale should make friends with the sea-mouse, who will serve as a guide so that the monster will never go astray . They alighted on the horn of a dead ox, and at once they changed to the handsome youths . ""I can save you. Get on my back and I will carry you to a place of safety,"" a whale says . ""Do all the good you can and make no fuss about it,"" XI--BLOCKHEAD HANS Far away in the country was an old mansion in which dwelt a squire well along in years and his two sons . They were convinced that had they known only half of what they did know . ""Here I come!"" Blockhead Hans shouted, and he sang so that the echoes were roused near and far . They were not speaking, but were turning over in their minds all the clever things they intended to say . ""I shall give it to the princess,"" he replied, and the brothers laughed and rode along . ""Of course it is,"" the brother who knew the dictionary could think of to say . ""It doesn't matter,"" the princess replied, ""Take him out."" The princess looked as if she thought him tiresome as she replied . XIII--CUNNING TOM Once there was a bad boy named Tom, and the older he grew, the wiser and slyer he thought himself . At last he took the cow to a deserted house which stood at a distance from any other . Tom then took a piece of chalk, ground it into powder, steeped it in a little water and rubbed it in spots and patches . XIV--A MISER'S HIRED MAN Tom escaped, but it was a rough life he led, and he was always in fear of punishment . Tom hired himself to an old miser of a farmer with whom he continued several years . At first they persisted in keeping on with the work, but finally the farmer convinced them they had been fooled . Tom threw a fine fat calf into the middle of the road and hid behind a hedge . ""You can try,"" the master said, but I don't believe you can do it . Tom slipped out from behind the hedge, secured the shoe, and ran back . Away ran Tom through the fields until he got ahead of the butcher . ""There's the calf I lost,"" Tom said, ""Oh, no!"" As soon as he was gone, Tom told his master he believed he could get it again . The butcher had a fine white face on it with chalk and water, but it was hoisted onto the horse . ""I am sixty years old, and never before have I seen so large and handsome a peach,"" she said . The old man said, ""I feel hungry,"" the old man affirmed . ""Do not be afraid,"" the boy said. ""You have often lamented that you have no child,"" the man replied . XVI--A WARRIOR'S HELPERS Peach-boy walked steadily and rapidly along the highway . ""You wish to go, and I will not stop you,"" the old man said . When the dog had eaten the dumpling, a big savage dog appeared . The monkey said: ""You are welcome to go with me"" Peach-boy and his companions came to the sea and saw nothing but waves . They sat up and begged, the monkey played tricks, and the pheasant sang a song . The three animals listened respectfully and promised implicit obedience . ""There can be no squabbling among ourselves if we are to win"" Peach-boy and his comrades loaded their boat with the hoarded island treasures . The pheasant quickly obeyed his orders and found the demons on the iron roofs of their houses . He swooped down and with one peck took off the head of a red demon . But the sound of their yells was truly terrible . A fire was blazing on the hearth, and near it was a comfortable chair . It was bad enough not to be left in peace seated by the fire drying oneself . A third time the voice spoke, and louder than ever . ""You'd better come down, Andrew Coffey,"" Patrick says . ""I'll punish you for the way you're neglecting me!"" Patrick Rooney cried . He was unslinging himself from the pole now, and his teeth glistened . Creating the works from public domain print editions means no one owns a United States copyright in these works .

The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher," Jeremy Fisher is a frog who lives in a damp little house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond. His larder and back passage are ""slippy-sloppy"" with water, but he likes getting his feet wet; no one ever scolds and he never catches cold. One day, Jeremy finds it raining and decides to go fishing. Should he catch more than five minnows, he will invite his friends to dinner. He puts on a Macintosh and shiny goloshes, takes his rod and basket, and sets off with ""enormous hops"" to the place where he keeps his lily-pad boat. He poles to a place he knows is good for minnows. Once there, he sits cross-legged on his lily-pad and arranges his tackle. He has ""the dearest little red float"". His rod is a stalk of grass and his line a horsehair. An hour passes without a nibble. He takes a break and lunches on a butterfly sandwich. A water beetle tweaks his toe, and rats rustling about in the rushes force him to seek a safer location. He drops his line into the water and immediately has a bite. It is not a minnow but little Jack Sharp, a stickleback. The fish escapes but not before Jeremy pricks his fingers on Jack's spines. A shoal of little fishes come to the surface to laugh at Jeremy. Jeremy sucks his sore fingers, but a trout rises from the water and seizes him with a snap (Mr. Jeremy screams, ""OW-OW-OW!!!""). The trout dives to the bottom, but finds the Macintosh tasteless and spits Jeremy out, swallowing only his goloshes. Jeremy bounces ""up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle"", and swims to the pond's edge. He scrambles up the bank and hops home through the meadow, quite sure he will never go fishing again. In the last few pages, Jeremy has put sticking plaster on his fingers and welcomes his friends, Sir Isaac Newton, a newt, and Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise, a tortoise who eats salad. Isaac wears a black and gold waistcoat and Ptolemy brings a salad in a string bag. Jeremy has prepared roasted grasshopper with ladybird sauce. The narrator describes the dish as a ""frog treat"", but thinks ""it must have been nasty!""

Dombey and Son," The story concerns Paul Dombey, the wealthy owner of the shipping company of the book's title, whose dream is to have a son to continue his business. The book begins when his son is born, and Dombey's wife dies shortly after giving birth. Following the advice of Mrs Louisa Chick, his sister, Dombey employs a wet nurse named Mrs Richards (Toodle). Dombey already has a daughter, Florence, whom he neglects. One day, Mrs Richards, Florence and her maid, Susan Nipper, secretly pay a visit to Mrs Richard's house in Staggs's Gardens so that she can see her children. During this trip, Florence becomes separated and is kidnapped for a short time by Good Mrs Brown before being returned to the streets. She makes her way to Dombey and Son's offices in the City and is guided there by Walter Gay, an employee, who first introduces her to his uncle, the navigation instrument maker Solomon Gills, at his shop the Wooden Midshipman. The child, also named Paul, is weak and often ill, and does not socialize normally with others; adults call him ""old fashioned"". He is intensely fond of his elder sister, Florence, who is deliberately neglected by her father as irrelevant and a distraction. He is sent away to Brighton, first for his health, where he and Florence lodge with the ancient and acidic Mrs Pipchin, and then for his education to Dr and Mrs Blimber's school, where he and the other boys undergo both an intense and arduous education under the tutelage of Mr Feeder, B.A. and Cornelia Blimber. It is here that Paul is befriended by a fellow pupil, the amiable Mr Toots. Here, Paul's health declines even further in this 'great hothouse' and he finally dies, still only six years old. Dombey pushes his daughter away from him after the death of his son, while she futilely tries to earn his love. In the meantime, Walter, who works for Dombey and Son, is sent off to work in Barbados through the manipulations of the firm's manager, Mr James Carker, 'with his white teeth', who sees him as a potential rival through his association with Florence. His boat is reported lost and he is presumed drowned. Walter's uncle leaves to go in search of Walter, leaving his great friend Captain Edward Cuttle in charge of the Midshipman. Meanwhile, Florence is now left alone with few friends to keep her company. Dombey goes to Leamington Spa with a new friend, Major Joseph B. Bagstock. The Major deliberately sets out to befriend Dombey in order to spite his neighbour in Princess's Place, Miss Tox, who has turned cold towards him owing to her hopes - through her close friendship with Mrs Chick - of marrying Mr Dombey. At the spa, Dombey is introduced via the Major to Mrs Skewton and her widowed daughter, Mrs Edith Granger. It is here that he develops an affection for Edith, encouraged by both the Major and the avaricious mother. After they return to London, Dombey remarries, effectively 'buying' the beautiful but haughty Edith as she and her mother are in a poor financial state. The marriage is loveless; his wife despises Dombey for his overbearing pride and herself for being shallow and worthless. Her love for Florence initially prevents her from leaving, but finally she conspires with Mr Carker to ruin Dombey's public image by running away together to Dijon. They do so after her last final argument with Dombey in which he once again attempts to subdue her to his will. When he discovers that she has left him, he blames Florence for siding with her stepmother, striking her on the breast in his anger, and she is forced to run away from home. Highly distraught, she finally makes her way to The Midshipman where she lodges with Captain Cuttle as he attempts to restore her to health. They are visited frequently by Mr Toots and his prizefighter companion, the Chicken, since Mr Toots has been desperately in love with Florence since their time together in Brighton. Dombey sets out to find his wife. He is helped by Mrs Brown and her daughter, Alice, who, as it turns out, was a former lover of Mr Carker. After being transported as a convict for criminal activities, which Mr. Carker had involved her in, she is seeking her revenge against him now that she has returned to England. Going to Mrs Brown's house, Dombey overhears the conversation between Rob the Grinder - who is in the employment of Mr Carker - and the old woman as to the couple's whereabouts and sets off in pursuit. In the meantime, in Dijon, Mrs Dombey informs Carker that she sees him in no better a light than she sees Dombey, that she will not stay with him and she flees their apartment. Distraught, with both his financial and personal hopes lost, Carker flees from his former employer's pursuit. He seeks refuge back in England, but being greatly overwrought, accidentally falls under a train and is killed. After Carker's death, it is discovered that he had been running the firm far beyond its means. This information is gleaned by Carker's brother and sister, John and Harriet, from Mr Morfin, the assistant manager at Dombey and Son, who sets out to help John Carker. He often overheard the conversations between the two brothers in which James, the younger, often abused John, the older, who was just a lowly clerk and who is sacked by Dombey because of his filial relationship to the former manager. Meanwhile, back at the Midshipman, Walter reappears, having been saved by a passing ship after floating adrift with two other sailors on some wreckage. After some time, he and Florence are finally reunited - not as 'brother' and 'sister' but as lovers, and they marry prior to sailing for China on Walter's new ship. This is also the time when Sol Gills returns to the Midshipman. As he relates to his friends, he received news whilst in Barbados that a homeward-bound China trader had picked up Walter and so had returned to England immediately. He said he had sent letters whilst in the Caribbean to his friend Ned Cuttle c/o Mrs MacStinger at Cuttle's former lodgings, and the bemused Captain recounts how he fled the place, thus never receiving them. Florence and Walter depart and Sol Gills is entrusted with a letter, written by Walter to her father, pleading for him to be reconciled towards them both. A year passes and Alice Brown has slowly been dying despite the tender care of Harriet Carker. One night Alice's mother reveals that Alice herself is the illegitimate cousin of Edith Dombey (which accounts for their similarity in appearance when they both meet). In a chapter entitled 'Retribution', Dombey and Son goes bankrupt. Dombey retires to two rooms in his house and all its contents are put up for sale. Mrs Pipchin, for some time the housekeeper, dismisses all the servants and she herself returns to Brighton, to be replaced by Mrs Richards. Dombey spends his days sunk in gloom, seeing no-one and thinking only of his daughter:He thought of her as she had been that night when he and his bride came home. He thought of her as she had been in all the home events of the abandoned house. He thought, now, that of all around him, she alone had never changed. His boy had faded into dust, his proud wife had sunk into a polluted creature, his flatterer and friend had been transformed into the worst of villains, his riches had melted away, the very walls that sheltered him looked on him as a stranger; she alone had turned the same, mild gentle look upon him always. Yes, to the latest and the last. She had never changed to him - nor had he ever changed to her - and she was lost. However, one day Florence returns to the house with her son, Paul, and is lovingly reunited with her father. Dombey accompanies his daughter to her and Walter&#39;s house where he slowly starts to decline, cared for by Florence and also Susan Nipper, now Mrs Toots. They receive a visit from Edth&#39;s Cousin Feenix who takes Florence to Edith for one final time - Feenix sought Edith out in France and she returned to England under his protection. Edith gives Florence a letter, asking Dombey to forgive her her crime before her departure to the South of Italy with her elderly relative. As she says to Florence, &#39;I will try, then to forgive him his share of the blame. Let him try to forgive me mine!&#39; The final chapter (LXII) sees Dombey now a white-haired old man, &#39;whose face bears heavy marks of care and suffering; but they are traces of a storm that has passed on for ever, and left a clear evening in its track&#39;. Sol Gills and Ned Cuttle are now partners at the Midshipman, a source of great pride to the latter, and Mr and Mrs Toots announce the birth of their third daughter. Walter is doing well in business, having been appointed to a position of great confidence and trust, and Dombey is the proud grandfather of both a grandson and grand-daughter whom he dotes on, and the book ends with the highly moving lines:'Dear grandpapa, why do you cry when you kiss me?' He only answers, 'Little Florence! Little Florence!' and smooths away the curls that shade her earnest eyes.

As You Like It," The play is set in a duchy in France, but most of the action takes place in a location called the Forest of Arden, which may be intended for the Ardennes in France, but is sometimes identified with Arden, Warwickshire, near Shakespeare's home town. Frederick has usurped the Duchy and exiled his older brother, Duke Senior. The Duke's daughter Rosalind has been permitted to remain at court because she is the closest friend and cousin of Frederick's only child, Celia. Orlando, a young gentleman of the kingdom who has fallen in love at first sight with Rosalind, is forced to flee his home after being persecuted by his older brother, Oliver. Frederick becomes angry and banishes Rosalind from court. Celia and Rosalind decide to flee together accompanied by the jester Touchstone, with Rosalind disguised as a young man and Celia disguised as a poor lady. Rosalind, now disguised as Ganymede (""Jove's own page""), and Celia, now disguised as Aliena (Latin for ""stranger""), arrive in the Arcadian Forest of Arden, where the exiled Duke now lives with some supporters, including ""the melancholy Jaques,"" a malcontent figure, who is introduced to us weeping over the slaughter of a deer. ""Ganymede"" and ""Aliena"" do not immediately encounter the Duke and his companions, as they meet up with Corin, an impoverished tenant, and offer to buy his master's rude cottage. Orlando and his servant Adam (a role possibly played by Shakespeare himself, though this story is said to be apocryphal), meanwhile, find the Duke and his men and are soon living with them and posting simplistic love poems for Rosalind on the trees. Rosalind, also in love with Orlando, meets him as Ganymede and pretends to counsel him to cure him of being in love. Ganymede says ""he"" will take Rosalind's place and ""he"" and Orlando can act out their relationship. The shepherdess Phebe, with whom Silvius is in love, has fallen in love with Ganymede (actually Rosalind), though ""Ganymede"" continually shows that ""he"" is not interested in Phebe. Touchstone, meanwhile, has fallen in love with the dull-witted shepherdess Audrey, and tries to woo her, but eventually is forced to be married first. William, another shepherd, attempts to marry Audrey as well, but is stopped by Touchstone, who threatens to kill him ""a hundred and fifty ways"". Finally, Silvius, Phebe, Ganymede, and Orlando are brought together in an argument with each other over who will get whom. Ganymede says he will solve the problem, having Orlando promise to marry Rosalind, and Phebe promise to marry Silvius if she cannot marry Ganymede. Orlando sees Oliver in the forest and rescues him from a lioness, causing Oliver to repent for mistreating Orlando. Oliver meets Aliena (Celia's false identity) and falls in love with her, and they agree to marry. Orlando and Rosalind, Oliver and Celia, Silvius and Phebe, and Touchstone and Audrey all are married in the final scene, after which they discover that Frederick has also repented his faults, deciding to restore his legitimate brother to the dukedom and adopt a religious life. Jaques, ever melancholy, declines their invitation to return to the court preferring to stay in the forest and to adopt a religious life as well. Rosalind speaks an epilogue to the audience, commending the play to both men and women in the audience.

Know you before whom? ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me . I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain . O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her . OLIVER. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have some part of your will . I pray you leave me. ORLANDO. I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoken such  I'll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of ambition . I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger, and if he dost him any slight disgrace, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap them by some treacherous device . If ever he come to-morrow, I will never wrestle for prize more, and so, God keep your worship! ROSALIND. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; and when I break that oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry. CELIA. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports . Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel CELIA. Prithee, who isn't that thou mean'st? TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly . LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of . DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS . Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness . CELIA. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man . O excellent young man! CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down . ORLANDO. I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd. FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man? OrLANDO . I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son, His youngest son, and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick. ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart. CELIA. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him . O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself . Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son? DUKE FREDERICK. Let me love him for that; and I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me . If with myself I hold intelligence, Or have acquaintance with mine own desires; If that I do not dream, or be not frantic- As I do trust I am not- then dear uncle, Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not . FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough . CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden. ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go? . I'll put myself in poor and mean attire, And with kind of umber smirch my face; So shall we pass along, And never stir assailants . DUKE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison? And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, Being native burghers of this desert city, Should, in their own confines, Have their round haunches gor'd . FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes. First, for his weeping into the needless stream: 'Poor deer,' quoth ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go? ADAM. No matter whither . I will not do, do how I can. Let me be your servant; Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty; For in my youth I am virtuous . O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed! Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion, And having that do choke their service up Even with the having . From seventeen years till now almost four-score Here lived I, but now live here no more . Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and I have by hard adventure found mine own. TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd . I recall the wooing of peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods, and AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques. JAQUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire You to please you . I'll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes; and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks . JAQUES FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach . DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast; And thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert . DUKE SENIOR. It is my only suit, Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise. I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please, for so fools have; And they most must laugh . JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good? Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you; I thought that all things had been savage here, And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment . But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time . There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffi SONG Blow, blow, thou winter wind, Thou art not so unkind As man's ingratitude; Thy tooth is not so keen . Heigh-ho! sing, &c. DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son, As you have whisper'd faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limn'd and living in your face, TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side . CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life . But in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well . As it is spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge. CELIA. Here comes my sister, reading a paper ROSALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country . So the heavenly synod was devised, Of many faces, eyes, and eyes . CELIA. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear . ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and therefore stood lamely in the verse . I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace . CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism. ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's apparel? ROSALEIND. It may well be called'd Jove's tree, when it JAQUES ROSALIND. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy. ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock . OrLANDO, with a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the  I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he. ROSALIND. You may as soon make her that you love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she does . I profess curing it by counsel. ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much. TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths . AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical? TOUCHSTEONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish . SIR OLIVER MARTEXT Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met . I will not take her on gift of any man, or the marriage is not lawful . TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey; We must be married or we must live in bawdry . CELIA ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep. I will be a knave of them all . Exeunt SCENE IV. Another part of the forest Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE SILviUS . The common executioner, Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard, Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon . Will you sterner be Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops? Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner; I fly thee, for I wouldn't in I pray you do not fall in love with me, For I am falser than vows made in wine; Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house, 'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by. Will you go, sister? Shepherdess, look on him better, And be not proud; though all the world could see, None could be so abus'd in sight as he. Come, to our flock. Exeunt I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him . I marvel why I answer'd not again; But that's all one: omittance is no quittance. I'll write it straight; The matter's in my head and in my heart; I will be bitter with him and passing short. Go with me, Silvius. Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES JA ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight . ORLANDO. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents the slander of his wife . ORLANDO. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'- CELIA. Go to. I do take thee, Rosalind, for wife. ROSALIND. Then you must say 'a day' without the 'ever.' ORLANDE. By my life, she will do as I do. ORLIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool! ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind. ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise . CELIA ROSALIND hath ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth-to sleep . Enter SILVIUS SILVUS . No, I protest, I know not the contents; Phebe did write it . ROS ALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter, And play the swaggerer. SILVIUS. Call you this chiding? CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd! ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, by him my love deny, And then I'll study how to die . OLIVER. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company . O, I have heard him speak of that same brother; And he did render him the most unnatural That liv'd amongst men . ROSALIND. And well I know he was unnatural. But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him . AUDREY TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown . The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when it was put into his mouth . WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit. TOUCH STONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for all your writers do consent that ipse is he; now O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf! OLIVER ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow . O, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes! I can live no longer by thinking. ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking . Know of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit . I have, since I was three year old, convers'd with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable . TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come, Audrey. Exeunt SCENE III. The forest Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA DUke SENIor. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that  ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing? ORLANDO. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her? PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after . I have promis'd to make all this matter even . Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY JAQUES . TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir . This is call'd the Retort Courteous. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true . JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie? JAQUES de BOYS is the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly . The Duke hath put on a religious life, And thrown into neglect the pompous court .

We will begin these rites, As we do trust they'll end, in true delights . If it be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue.

Insectivorous Plants," All page numbers refer to where the quotes can be found in the 1875, John Murray edition. From his initial observations in 1860 of Drosera rotundifolia, the common sundew, Darwin developed a series of experiments ultimately establishing how ""excellently adapted"" these plants are to catching insects (p. 3). Darwin knew that these plants flourish in nitrogen-limited environments, growing in bogs, poor peaty soil and moss (p. 18). Most plants receive nutrients from the soil by their roots, but these plants have poor root systems and have adapted to receive nutrients (primarily nitrogenous substances) from captured insects. Darwin noted that Drosera and other carnivorous plants also feed on seeds, thus also making them vegetable feeders (p. 134). His notable observations are (p. 3–4): 1. The sensitivity of the glands to slight pressure and to minute doses of nitrogenous substances. He noted that although there is extreme sensitivity it is wholly appropriate to the purpose of gaining sustenance, e.g. they do not respond to heavy rain falling on them nor to the wind blowing other leaves against them. They have adapted well to insects alighting upon them and this saves them from wasting energy through excess movement. 2. The power to digest nitrogenous substances by secreting digestive matter and then absorbing them. He noted that digestion follows a similar pattern to animal processes (p. 135) in that acid is added to ferment the nutrient source(equivalent to pepsin). How they adapted this process from already existing substances in their system is explored later on in the book (p. 361). 3. The changes which took place within the cells when the glands are excited in various ways. A major part of the book enumerates his experiments on Drosera rotundifolia. Darwin then turns his attention to other varieties of insectivorous plants and makes comparisons, noting that in some cases different parts of the leaf are used for digestion and others for absorption of decayed matter (p. 330–331). He conjectured that plants may become adapted exclusively to one of these functions by gradually losing the other over a period of time. This would explain how Pinguicula and Utricularia came to utilise different functions even though they belong to the same family; p. 331). Darwin wrote in his autobiography that ""the fact that a plant should secrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment, closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a remarkable discovery.""

Equality," The story takes up immediately after the events of Looking Backward with the main characters from the first novel, Julian West, Doctor Leete, and his daughter Edith. West tells his nightmare of return to the 19th century to Edith, who is sympathetic. West's citizenship in the new America is recognized, and he goes to the bank to obtain his own account, or ""credit card"", from which he can draw on the annual stipend all citizens receive. He learns that Edith and her mother do not normally wear the long skirts he has seen them in (they have been wearing them so his 19th century sensibilities will not be shocked), and when Edith learns that he would not be shocked to see them dressed otherwise, immediately runs into the house and comes out dressed as a modern woman in a pants suit. Clothing varies widely, since it is made of strengthened paper, and is recycled when dirty and replaced at very small expense (shoes and dishes are made of variations on the same substance). Julian learns that women are free to compete in many of the same trades as men; the manager of the paper factory he goes to view is a woman. Edith herself is in the second year of the three year general labor period required of everyone before choosing a trade, but is on leave from that employment. The two tour a tenement house, in which no one now lives, kept as a reminder of things how used to be and a reminder not to go back to them. Julian opens his safe (a device unknown in 2000 outside museums). Dr. Leete sees his mortgages and securities not as long-obsolete claims to ownership interest in things, but rather in people and their labor. The papers are worthless except as antiquities, as most of such papers were burned at the conclusion of the economic transition, in a great blaze on the former site of the New York Stock Exchange. The gold coins in the safe are admired for their prettiness, but are also worthless. Julian learns more about the world of the year 2000. Handwriting has been virtually replaced by phonograph records, and jewelry is no longer used, since jewels are now worthless. Julian is amazed by a television-like device, called the electroscope. World communication is simplified, since everyone now speaks a universal language in addition to his native tongue. Not only are there motor cars, but also private air cars. Everyone is now vegetarian, and the thought of eating meat is looked upon with revulsion. The book concludes with an almost uninterrupted series of lectures from Dr. Leete and other characters, mostly concerning how the idyllic state West has arrived in was achieved.

Sanctuary," Angel and Co. are enjoying some downtime at the karaoke bar Caritas when a loud explosion occurs. The gang and the rest of the bar are attracted outside. A building nearby is on fire. It seems that it may have been a diversionary tactic to distract from a drive-by shooting. When the smoke clears, Fred has gone missing. It seems Fred has been kidnapped, so Team Angel questions everyone nearby. Around a dozen demons were direct eyewitnesses, but each one has a different story. Whether it was gangs, monsters, or a runaway Fred, the team soon realize demons do not make the most reliable eyewitnesses.
","This file was first posted on May 13, 2003 by Edith Wharton . It is not often that youth allows itself to feel undividedly happy: the sensation is too much the result of selection and elimination to be within reach of the awakening clutch on life . Denis Peyton was used to being met with a smile . He had found life, from the start, an uncommonly agreeable business . Kate Orme was not without an amused perception of her future husband's point of view . Kate knew only that a darkness had crossed her sky and left it as unclouded as before . It was horrible to think that one’s deepest security was a mere sense of escape--that happiness was no more than a reprieve . The perversity of such ideas was emphasized by Peyton’s approach . “You_ were not there--_you_ didn’t have to--” He paused before her with outstretched hands of argument . “I did all I could--it’s not _my_ fault, is it?” “Your fault? Denis!” “She wouldn’t take the money” He broke off, checked by her awakened glance . Kate sat motionless, her head bent, her hands clasped about her knees . “Could the courts have been mistaken?” Peyton started up again, and threw himself into another chair . She had a sense of walking along a narrow ledge of consciousness above a sheer hallucinating depth into which she dared not look . Kate Orme was engaged in one of those rapid mental excursions which were forever sweeping her from the straight path of the actual into uncharted regions of conjecture . For the first moment all was indistinguishable blackness; then she began to detect vague shapes and confused gestures in the depths . There were people below there, men like Denis, girls like herself--for under the unlikeness she felt the strange affinity Kate’s visualizing habit gave a hateful precision and persistency to the image she had evoked . The horror of it took her by the throat--she drew a choking breath, and felt the tears on her face . “I--I couldn’t help it,” she stammered, struggling in the sudden release of her pent compassion . Kate slipped into the inexorable continuity of life, found herself gazing over a scene of ruin lit up by the punctual recurrence of habit as nature’s calm stare lights the morrow of a whirlwind . She must go bounding on, racked, broken, but alive in every fibre, and from the pressure of outward claims: the midday halt, during which the Arthur's was like a child who had put a match to the curtains, and stands agape at the blaze . It was horribly naughty to put the match--but beyond that the child’s responsibility did not extend . Arthur had drifted into living with her as a man drifts into drink or opium . He had fallen ill, and she had nursed him devoted Arthur, in his last hours, had confessed to the marriage, but had also acknowledged its folly . After his death, when Denis came to look about him and make inquiries, he found that the witnesses, if there had been any, were dispersed and undiscoverable . The whole question hinged on Arthur’s statement to his brother, and with it the scandal, the humiliation, the life- “Everything is not at an end for you--everything is just beginning. You must clear yourself of this guilt; and there is only one way--to confess it. And you must give back the money.” This seemed to strike him as conclusive proof of her irrelevance . “I did wrong--I did horribly wrong-but that is not the way to repair it,” he said . a secret sin would have made Mrs. Peyton wretched, but it would not have killed her . She would have accepted private regrets as the genteel equivalent of open expiation . Kate could even imagine her extracting a “lesson” from the providential fact that her son had not been found out . Mrs. Peyton's conception of her was still under arraignment . She had remained enthroned in a semi-invalidism which prohibited effort while it did not preclude diversion . Kate had to sit through the usual prelude of ejaculation and anecdote . Kate felt herself slowly petrifying under the warm drip of Mrs. Peyton’s platitudes . The law-suit was a cruel ordeal to him--the revelation of poor Arthur’s infirmities . But such sensitiveness may be carried to excess . It is _beautiful_ that you should both feel so; most beautiful; but you know religion teaches us not to yield too much to our grief . Just after dear Denis’s inheritance has removed the last obstacle to your marriage, this sad incident comes to show how desperately he needs you, how cruel it would be to ask him to defer his happiness” Mrs. Peyton paused again, and then soft Kate's shoulder fell back from the door which she had instinctively barricaded . ""No, no, you misunderstand me. I can make no promise,"" she declared . Mrs. Peyton stood up, quivering, panting with the exhaustion of the struggle . Mr. Orme affected, under such circumstances, a bluff and hearty stoicism as remote as possible from Mrs. Peyton’s deprecating evasion of facts . It was a bad business; he was sorry Kate should have been mixed up with it; but she would see that life wasn’t exactly a Sunday-school story . The best way of repairing a fault was the social health must be preserved: the means devised were the result of long experience and the collective instinct of self-preservation . She had meant to tell her father that her marriage had been put off; but she now abstained from doing so, not from any doubt of Mr. Orme’s acquiescence . In her own room, she passed through that travail of the soul of which the deeper life is born Marriage meant to her, as it means to girls brought up in ignorance of life, simply the exquisite prolongation of wooing . But now through the blur of sensations one image strangely persisted--the image of Denis’s child . It was impossible that she should marry some one else--he was one of the men who are fated to marry, and she needed not his mother’s reminder that her abandonment of Dick Peyton met her with the question on the threshold, drawing her gaily into the little square room . Mrs. Denis Peyton remarked, as her circuit finally brought her to the prettily appointed tea-table . It was to serve, on this occasion, as the scene of a tea designed to introduce a certain young lady to her son’s labours . Denis Peyton had died after seven years of marriage, when his son was barely six . During those seven years he had managed to squander the best part of his fortune . she had even been accused by those judicious persons of having encouraged poor Denis’s improvidence for the gratification of her own ambition . Dick was engrossed in his work, and his first successes developed his capacity for application . He gave lavishly where he was sure of a return; but it remained to be seen if he were capable of production without recognition . Mrs. Peyton had brought him up in a scorn of material rewards . Paul Darrow was a young man full of crude seriousness, who had won a scholarship . Mrs. Peyton was seconded in the task by a friend whose acquaintance Dick had made at the Beaux Arts . Darrow's gifts had at once attracted the younger student . Mrs. Peyton had heard a great deal about Miss Clemence Verney . But, ample as her information was, it remained perplexing and contradictory . ""I think I’ll tell Gill to clean out the work-room before they come,"" his mother replied . Mrs. Peyton sat silent, considering his flushed face and illumined eye . She remembered something that Darrow had once said of him: ""Dick always sees the end too soon."" ""When I next appear, it will either be with my heel on Paul’s neck--poor old Paul--or else--being dragged lifeless from the arena!"" His mother nervously took up Mrs. Peyton noted that Miss Verney alone knew what these symbols stood for . The party had already drifted back to the tea-table when a hesitating knock announced Darrow’s approach . Mr. Darrow entered with his usual air of having blundered in by mistake and thrown into deeper confusion by the necessity of being introduced to the ladies grouped about the urn . Mrs. Peyton was struck by the way in which the girl led the topic back to the special application of it which interested her . ""I don’t know that my son needs the incentive. He is almost too ambitious,"" Miss Verney said . “He is an extraordinarily interesting man. It must be so glorious to be a man and go crashing through obstacles, straight up to the thing one is after. I’m afraid I Dick was so silent about such matters that, outside of his profession, he seemed to have no personal life . Mrs. Peyton surprised him in the act, suggesting he should defer it and give her a few moments’ talk . ""I wish the competition were over!” she exclaimed, conscious that her voice had betrayed her . ""Oh, well, Dick’s a man,"" said Mrs. Peyton . ""I wish he didn’t feel so sure of it. You mustn’t think I’m afraid for him,"" said Darrow . Dick rose, putting down his coffee-cup and half-smoked cigarette . ""I’m not tired; only a little strung-up,"" he returned smiling . Mrs. Peyton was silent. She knew it was useless to contend with her son about his work . Dick's illness was evidently grave, but might not regard her coming as an intrusion? The doctor has sent a good nurse, and is coming again later . The beef-juice ordered and dispatched, she was left to a vigil in melancholy contrast to that of the previous evening . As she sat there in the radius of lamp-light, she saw that her love for her boy had Mrs. Peyton sat speechless, gazing at the date of the letter . She dropped the letter, and hid her face in her hands . Dick told his mother that he must look over things at his office . Mrs. Peyton dismissed as morbid any other view of the case . The nature of the offer removed it from practical issues to the idealizing region of sentiment . Mrs. Peyton sat with her eyes fixed on her clasped hands, and her son paced the room restlessly . She paused again, and then said, lifting a tremulous glance to his face . “Oh, I suppose so. I’ve told you it isn’t a question of time. I see now that mine are not worth bothering with,” she said . Kate Peyton felt in every fibre that a crisis in her son’s life had been reached, that the act now before him would have a determining effect on his whole future . The peculiar misery of her situation was that she could not put this intuition, this foresight, at his service . Love such as hers had a great office, the office of preparation and direction; but it must know how to hold its Denis Peyton was vexed at her own readiness to see a portent in the simplest incident . But as she sat listening, the closed door seemed to symbolize a refusal to share in his trial, a hardening of herself against his need of her . She had never lost the sense of having snatched her child from some dim peril . Slighter obstacles have deflected the course of events in those indeterminate moments when the soul floats between two tides . She sprang up quickly, and as her hand touched the latch she heard his step on the stairs . He came in hurriedly, yet with a kind of reluctance beneath his haste . ""Don’t expect me till late--don’ She saw Dick yielding to his opportunity, winning love, happiness and success in the act by which he lost himself . he would win the competition, would marry Miss Verney, would press on to achievement through the opening which the first success had made for him . Mrs. Peyton paused, trying to choose her words with deliberation . It was clear now that Dick had not spoken, and she felt the responsibility that devolved upon her . The glance did not disconcert Miss Verney . Mrs. Peyton flushed, her maternal pride in revolt; but the answer was checked on her lips by the sense of the girl’s unexpected insight . The mother felt at the first intrusion on her privilege of judging her child; and her voice had a flutter of resentment . ""You must have a poor opinion of his character,"" she said . Mrs. Peyton listened with an intensity of attention that left her reply unprepared . The girl said that in this case he has fallen below his opportunity . ""He didn’t tell you of--of an opportunity to make up for the time he lost?"" she said . Miss Verney's eyes fixed themselves on her in a commiserating stare . ""If he won the competition he would be winning it on false pretenses"" Mrs. Peyton saw that she had slipped into self-betrayal . Mrs. Peyton shrank from this detection of a tacit interference with her son's liberty of action . She longed--how passionately he would never know--to stand apart from him in this struggle between his two destinies . Only four days remained before the date fixed for the sending in of the designs . Kate sat motionless, her hands clasped on the arms of her chair, her head erect, in an attitude of avowed attention . She could lengthen out all Gill’s abbreviations, interpret all his allusions, and reconstruct Dick’s answers from the questions addressed to him. Mrs. Peyton, left alone, found it easier to continue her vigil by the drawing-room fire than to carry up to the darkness and silence of her own room the truth she had been at such pains to acquire . She had no thought of sitting up for Dick. Doubtless, his dinner over, he would rejoin Gill at the office, and prolong through, the night the task in which she now knew him to be Kate saw the succession of events spread out before her like a map, and the astuteness of the girl’s policy frightened her . By pledging herself to Dick she had secured his pledge in return . She had given him a foretaste of its results . She put out her hand and drew him down to her . ""She’ll be the making of me, you know, mother,"" he said, as they leaned together . He dropped down beside her with a deprecating laugh . She felt as if a strange man had gone out of her house . She wandered from room to room, aimlessly, trying to adjust herself to their solitude . There was the mortal pang, the stroke from which there was no healing . In her round of the rooms she came at last to Dick’s study upstairs . Sculpture_ will begin its sittings on Monday, and to-morrow is the last day on which designs may be sent in to the committee . She was seized by a sudden longing to seek Dick out, to fall on her knees and plead with him . When she sprang up to ring for a cab; but she was sank back again, breathing as if after a Mrs. Peyton felt a throb of anger at the girl’s bright air of unconcern . She forgot that she too was talking, smiling, holding out her hand to newcomers . Then it occurred to her that, to Clemence Verney, there was no tragedy in the situation . At length the feeling of humiliation and defeat grew unbearable . a moment the night watchman opened the door, drawing back amazed at the shining apparition which confronted him . Mrs. Peyton tried to adapt himself to the situation by a vague stammer of apology . The watchman apparently did not think it proper to offer any comment on this unusual proceeding . There were ten flights to climb: at every one her breath failed her . Darrow and Clemence Verney sat behind the urn observing them . She slipped noiselessly across the carpet, pushed open the swinging door, and stood on the threshold of the work-room . Here the gas-lights hung a green-shaded circle of brightness over the great draughting-table .

Through the Looking-Glass," Alice is playing with a white kitten (whom she calls ""Snowdrop"") and a black kitten (whom she calls ""Kitty"")—the offspring of Dinah, Alice's cat in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland—when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's reflection. Climbing up on the fireplace mantel, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she is able to step through it to an alternative world. In this reflected version of her own house, she finds a book with looking-glass poetry, ""Jabberwocky"", whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up. Upon leaving the house (where it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers have the power of human speech; they perceive Alice as being a ""flower that can move about."" Elsewhere in the garden, Alice meets the Red Queen (now human-sized), who impresses Alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds—a reference to the chess rule that queens are able to move any number of vacant squares at once, in any direction, making them the most ""agile"" of the pieces. The Red Queen reveals to Alice that the entire countryside is laid out in squares like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank/row in a chess match. Alice is placed in the second rank as one of the White Queen's pawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that literally jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move. She then meets the fat twin brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, whom she knows from the famous nursery rhyme. After reciting the long poem ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"", the Tweedles draw Alice's attention to the Red King—loudly snoring away under a nearby tree—and maliciously provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she exists only as an imaginary figure in the Red King's dreams (thereby implying that she will cease to exist the instant he wakes up). Finally, the brothers begin acting out their nursery-rhyme by suiting up for battle, only to be frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them predicts. Alice next meets the White Queen, who is very absent-minded but boasts of (and demonstrates) her ability to remember future events before they have happened. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with (seemingly) nonsensical shouting about ""crabs"" and ""feathers"". (Unknown to Alice, these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing—and thus the Queen/Sheep, for a change, is speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way!) After crossing yet another brook into the sixth rank, Alice immediately encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in ""Jabberwocky"" (in the process, introducing Alice and the reader to the concept of portmanteau words) before his inevitable fall. ""All the king's horses and all the king's men"" come to Humpty Dumpty's assistance, naturally, and are accompanied by the White King along with the Lion and the Unicorn, who again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting each other. In this chapter, the March Hare and Hatter of the first book make a brief re-appearance in the guise of ""Anglo-Saxon messengers"" called ""Haigha"" and ""Hatta"" (i.e. ""Hare"" and ""Hatter""—these names are the only hint given as to their identities other than John Tenniel's illustrations). Upon leaving the Lion and Unicorn to their fight, Alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the Red Knight, who is intent on capturing the ""white pawn"" Alice until the White Knight comes to her rescue. Escorting her through the forest towards the final brook-crossing, the Knight recites a long poem of his own composition, and repeatedly falls off his horse—his clumsiness is a reference to the ""eccentric"" L-shaped movements of chess knights, and may also be interpreted as a self-deprecating joke about Lewis Carroll's own physical awkwardness and stammering in real life. Bidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice steps across the last brook and is automatically crowned a queen (the crown materialising abruptly on her head). She soon finds herself in the company of both the White and Red Queens who relentlessly confound Alice by using word play to thwart her attempts at logical discussion. They then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by the newly crowned Alice (of which Alice herself had no prior knowledge). Alice arrives and seats herself at her own party which quickly turns to a chaotic uproar (much like the ending of the first book) in which Alice finally grabs the Red Queen, believing her to be responsible for all the day's nonsense, and begins shaking her violently with all her might. (By thus ""capturing"" the Red Queen, Alice unknowingly puts the Red King—who has remained stationary throughout the book—into checkmate, and is allowed to wake up.) Alice suddenly awakes in her armchair to find herself holding the black kitten, whom she deduces to have been the Red Queen all along, with the white kitten having been the White Queen. The story ends with Alice recalling the speculation of the Tweedle brothers, that everything may have, in fact, been a dream of the Red King and that Alice might herself be no more than a figment of his imagination. One final poem is inserted by the author as a sort of epilogue which suggests that life itself is but a dream.

Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace . Kitty squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning . Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say? Well, that’s _your_ fault, for keeping your eyes open, it wouldn’t have happened . You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week, I suppose, when The Red Queen was set up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate . But the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly . Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House . You can just see a little _pee Alice had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room . The first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace . In another moment, Alice was down on her hands and knees watching the cinders . Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket . The King was sitting sulkily among the ashes, as if it was the most likely place to find one . “You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open!” she cried out . 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe . ""Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Be The Garden of Live Flowers “I should see the garden far better,” said Alice to herself, “if I could get to the top of that hill: and here’s a path that leads straight to it! Well then, I’ll try it the other way.” And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, and always coming back to the house, do what she would “I don’t care about the colour,” the Tiger-lily remarked . “If only her petals curled up a little more, she’d be all right!” Alice asked . There was silence in a moment, and several of the daisies turned white . Alice said, not choosing to notice the Rose’s last remark . “There’s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,” said the Rose . ""I wonder how you do it—but she’s more bushy than you are,” said Alice . Alice wondered a little at this, but was too much in awe of the Queen to disbelieve it . “I’ll try it when I go home,” the Queen said, looking at her watch: “I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty.” “When you say ‘garden,’—_I’ve_ seen gardens, compared with which this Alice cried, “Faster! Faster!” and dragged her along . The Queen said, “I’m quite content to stay here—only I _am_ so hot and thirsty!” The Queen took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here and there . Alice said, putting in a peg to mark the distance, “I shall give you your directions—have another biscuit?” “Thirst quenched, I hope?” said the Queen . At the end of _three_ yards I shall repeat them—for fear of your forgetting them . “A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know,” Alice Alice ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks . The Guard put his head in at the window, looking angrily at Alice . And again the chorus of voices went on . The little voice sighed deeply: it was _very_ unhappy, evidently, and Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it . The consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature . The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in and said, “It’s only a brook we have to jump over.” Everybody seemed satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all. “However, it’ll take us into the Fourth Square, that’s some comfort!” she said to Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering . The Gnat amused itself by humming round and round her head . Alice sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks . “I wonder what’ll become of _my_ name when I go in? I shouldn’t like to lose it at all—because they’d have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one.” But then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name . “What _does_ it call itself, I wonder Tweedledum and Tweedlingee were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other’s neck . They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was just looking round to see if the word ‘TWEEDLE’ was written at the back of each collar . “If you think we’re wax-works,” said Tweedlee “You’ve been wrong!” cried Alice, passing on to Tweedledee . “The first thing in a visit is to say ‘How d’ye do?’ and shake hands . Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of hurting the other one’s feelings; so, as best way out of the difficulty, she took hold of The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand; They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand: ‘If this were only cleared away,’ They said, ‘it _would_ be grand!’ ‘If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year, Do you suppose,’ the Walrus said . ‘I doubt it “You’ve had a pleasant run! Shall we be trotting home again?’ But answer came there none— And that was scarcely odd, because They’d eaten every one.” “I like the Walrus best,” said Alice . “But he ate as many as he could get,” said Tweedledee. “I’m afraid he’ll catch cold Tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist . “I knew it was!” cried Alice, beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair . But he couldn’t quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella, with only his head out . “I’m far worse off than you!” said Tweedledum, who had overheard the remark . “We _must_ have a bit of a fight, but I don’t care about going on long,” said Alice, thinking it a good opportunity to make peace . “I’m very glad I happened to be in the way,” Alice said . “I don’t want any _to-day_, at any rate.” “You couldn’t have it if you _did_ want it,” Alice objected. “No, it can’t,” the Queen said. “I’m sure _mine_ only works one way,” Alice remarked . “Oh, things that happened the week after next,” the Queen replied in a careless tone . “Why, I’ve done all the screaming already,” said the Queen . “Only I never can remember the rule. You must be very happy, living in this wood, and being glad whenever you like!” cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands in despair . Alice was in a little dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles . ""You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,"" said the Sheep, very gently . But these, as it happened, Alice had _not_ got: “I’m not a bird!” Alice asked at last, rather vexed . “Oh, please! There are some scented rushes!” Alice cried in a sudden transport of delight . ""I only hope the boat won’t tipple over!” Alice said . The Sheep went on with her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened . ""I wish it hadn’t let go—I should so like to see a little crab to take home with me!” she said . “Only you _must_ eat them both, if you buy two,” said Alice, as she put the money down on the counter  Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on the top of a high wall . ""I said you _looked_ like an egg, Sir,"" Alice said . Alice said: ""Some people have no more sense than a baby"" Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a sudden passion . “Now I declare that’s too bad!” Alice said . ""I’m afraid I can’t quite remember it,” Alice explained . Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a minute or two . ""I know it’s very ignorant of me,"" Alice said, in humble a tone . “I’m not offended,” said Alice . Humpty Dumpty was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Alice began again . “I mean by ‘impenetrability’ that we’ve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you’d mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don’t mean to stop here all the rest of your life ‘_mimsy_’ is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round—something like a live mop’, said Alice . “I’m afraid I’m giving you a great deal of trouble,” said Humpty Dumpty . ‘_I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it Humpty Dumpty replied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake . Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never opened his eyes, she said “Good-bye!” “I’ve sent them all!” the King remarked in a fretful tone . “To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why, it’s as much as _I_ can do to see real people, by this light!” said Alice . “This young lady loves you with an H,” the King said . “I feel faint—Give me a ham sandwich!” said the Messenger . Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal . “You might as well try to stop a Bandersnatch!” Alice asked, so they trotted on in silence, till they came in sight of a great crowd . They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was standing . “Were you happy in prison, dear child?” Haigha said . “I had the best of it this time?” he said to the King . “I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters!” said Alice . The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said “Talk, child!” Alice couldn’t help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: “What’s this?” The Lion looked at Alice wearily . Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife . “I say, this isn’t fair!” cried the Unicorn, as she returned to her place with the empty dish . ""The Monster has given the Lion twice as much as me!” said Alice . Alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment . The Red Knight drew up at Alice’s side, and tumbled off his horse just as the Red Knight had done . Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment as he mounted again . ""I don’t want to be anybody’s prisoner,"" said the White Knight . ""I’ll see you safe to the end of the wood—and then I must go back, you know."" ""Now one can breathe more easily,"" said Alice . “I’ve got a plan for keeping the hair from _falling_ off,” said Alice . The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the remark . ""I’m afraid you’ve not had much practice in riding,” Alice said . “The great art of riding,” the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice, waving his right arm as he spoke, “is to keep—” Here the sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun . “I hope no bones are broken?” The Knight said, as if he didn’t mind breaking two or three of them. “You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, The Knight looked solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh . “I’m afraid you must have hurt him,” she said in a trembling voice, “being on the top of his head.” “But that’s a different kind of fastness,” Alice objected . “You are sad,” the Knight said in an anxious tone: “let me sing you a song to comfort you.” “Is it very long?” Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day . “Oh, that’s the name of the song, is it?” Alice said, trying to feel interested . I was thinking of a way To feed oneself on batter, And so go on from day to day Getting a little fatter . I shook him well from side to side, Until his face was blue . And these I do not sell for gold Or coin of silvery shine But for a copper halfpenny, And that will purchase nine . “I hope so,” the Knight said doubtfully: “but you didn’t cry so much as I thought you would.” So they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into the forest . “There he goes! Right on his head as usual! But it won’t take long to see him _off_, I expect,” Alice said to herself, as she stood “Why, don’t you see, child—” poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone . “You _should_ have meant! You couldn’t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.” The Red Queen said to Alice, “I invite you to Alice’s dinner-party this afternoon.” “I didn’t know I was to have a “Can you do Subtraction? Take nine from eight,” the Red Queen interrupted . Alice replied very readily: “but—” “She can’t do Subtract,” said the White Queen . “The dog’s temper would remain,” Alice considered . “I wish Queens never asked questions,” the White Queen said in an anxious tone . “The cause of lightning,” Alice said very decidedly, “is the thunder—no, no!” she hastily corrected herself. “I meant the other way,” the Red Queen said . The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alice’s shoulder . “I haven’t got a nightcap with me,” said the Red Queen . In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud . Alice was so hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him . “I’ve been knocking at it!” the Frog said impatiently. “You let _it_ alone,” he panted out . Alice sat down in the dish, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing for some one to speak . The Red Queen looked sulky, and growled “Pudding—Alice; Alice—pudding. Remove the pudding!” and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick . “I wonder how you’d like it The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice’s cheek . “First, the fish must be caught.’ That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it . ‘Let it lie in a dish!’ It is easy, because it already is in it. ‘Bring it here! Let me sup!’ The Red Queen said . The Red Queen dwindled down to the size of a little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round after her own shawl . At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised to be surprised at anything _now_ . It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens that, whatever you say to them, they _ Kitty, it _must_ have been either me or the Red King, I wonder? You’d better not mention it to your friends just yet, for I’m not sure . You should _not_ go on licking your paw like that—as if Dinah hadn’t washed you this morning!

The Poet," The book starts with Jack McEvoy, a crime reporter for the Rocky Mountain News (""Death is my beat""), relating how the news of his brother Sean's suicide was broken to him. Sean was a homicide detective with the Denver Police, who was found dead in his car in a remote parking lot. A one-sentence suicide note was found in the car with him, and it seemed impossible that someone else could have killed him. McEvoy, though, is reluctant to accept that his brother had succumbed to depression resulting from his investigations, even though the last one was particularly brutal: Theresa Lofton, a young college student, who was found in a park in two pieces. After much investigation on his own, including retracing his brother's investigation into the Lofton case, Jack concludes that his brother's death was simply made to look like a suicide by a serial killer. By focusing on homicide detectives who committed suicide in a similar fashion and left a one-sentence note quoting the works of Edgar Allan Poe (as Sean's did), Jack finds three clear matches to his brother's death. When the FBI finally realizes that he is on to something and attempts to block him from further access, he is able to trade his knowledge of the other deaths (one of which the FBI had not uncovered) for a role with the FBI investigative team headed by Robert Backus, the son of a famous agent within the bureau who has been overshadowed by his father's legend. Assigned the duty of handling him is agent Rachel Walling, one of Backus' main proteges, and the two of them become personally involved. The FBI nicknames the serial killer ""The Poet"" due to his use of Poe's lines with the victims. As the case focuses on an Internet network of pedophiles and one in particular (William Gladden), McEvoy is taken along on the operation to arrest Gladden, who is suspicious of the set-up and kills the FBI agent trying to arrest him, Gordon Thorson (Walling's ex-husband). McEvoy ends up killing Gladden himself while being held hostage. However, Gladden's comments about his brother's death lead McEvoy to believe that Gladden was not the killer, even though the case has been officially closed. He then finds evidence that the killings had a connection to the FBI and identifies a phone call to the FBI from Thorson's room that he links to a ""boasting"" fax sent to the bureau by The Poet. Since McEvoy knew that Walling had sent Thorson on a fake errand to buy condoms during the time the fax was sent, he suspects Walling of being The Poet and of posting to the pedophile network under the name ""Eidolon"", another Poe reference. He then learns that Walling's father, a cop, had committed suicide when she was a teenager ... and had been suspected by the investigating officers of molesting Rachel over a period of time. Since pedophiles tend to have been abused as children, McEvoy becomes worried enough to tell Backus of his suspicions. Backus tells McEvoy that they'll set a trap for Walling and then takes him to a remote location—where Backus drugs McEvoy into nonresistance. He admits that he himself is both Eidolon and The Poet, because the room mistakenly billed to Thorson was actually the one in which he stayed. He admits to all of the deaths and to his setup of Gladden as the ""fall guy"" for the murders. As Backus prepares to sodomize and then kill McEvoy, Walling (who was suspicious because of messages that she had received from both men) shows up and eventually saves McEvoy's life by knocking Backus out the window and down a long hill. Later the police find a body, however it is left open if this is Backus. Meanwhile, as the facts of the case become known, Walling's judgment is called into question due to her personal relationship with McEvoy and her professional relationship with Backus. A tabloid publishes a photo of McEvoy and Walling together. However, because McEvoy suspected her, Walling ends their relationship and takes a leave to Italy. McEvoy then takes a leave from his paper to write a book about the events, although Walling explains to him that the book will forever taint the FBI because of Backus.
","By Meredith Nicholson THE POET. Illustrated. OTHERWISE PHYLLIS. With Illustrations. THE SIEGE OF THE SEVEN SUITORS. With illustrations. The Poet All the People Loved was a philosopher also, but his philosophy was not quite equal to forecasting the destiny of little Marjorie . Mrs. Waring’s daughters had been Marjorie threw aside the tennis racket and bounded across the lawn, darting in and out among the children, laughingly eluding small hands thrust out to catch her . The Poet wished that Herrick might have been there; it was his habit to think, when something pleased him particularly, that “Keats would have liked that!” She tripped away The Poet, searching for Marjorie in the throng of children, made no reply . ""You are a poet,"" Mrs. Waring resumed tauntingly, with the privilege of old friendship . Little Marjorie, as she stood forlornly against the pergola, haunted him still in spite of her capitulation to the charms of her Aunt Marian . Every day the postman brought him letters in dismaying numbers from people of all sorts and conditions who testified to the validity of his message . It was a high privilege to comfort and uplift so many; and if he Sympathy spoke in her face and from the tranquil depths of her violet eyes . “I shall hate whoever said it, forever and forever!” she averred . The person who hurt my feelings is the nicest possible person and one of my best friends . Marian Agnew withheld the reply on which he had counted on his departure . ""I wish I could say no, and I can’t tell you how sorry I am to disappoint you--you, of all men! I know you wouldn’t want me to be dishonest--to make the answer you expected merely to please you. But I’m not sure I think as you do “I’m afraid that isn’t quite true,” said the Poet . “You must do just what I tell you--will you promise, every single boy and girl?” he exclaimed . The Poet had found within an hour’s journey of the soldiers’ monument the material for a thousand poems . It expressed the high altitudes of aspiration and endeavor of his own people . Frederick Fulton remarked that the Poet sent me back so much when I was young, and even after I wasn’t so young, that the account isn’t balanced yet! There are things in those verses of yours that I remember--they were very delicate, and beautifully put together,--cobwebs with dew clinging to them . I suppose we should be threshing out old straw--you and I--writing of English skylarks and the gorse and the yew and nightingales, instead of what we see out of the window, here at home . A scientist would be caught up quick enough if he wrote of something he knew nothing about--if, for example, an astronom Miles Redfield had a lot of talent--maybe not genius but undeniable talent . He had been to an art school and made a fine record, and this, he used to say jokingly, fitted him for a bank clerkship . The Poet dropped the paper-cutter and allowed Fulton to grope for it to give himself time to think . ""I want to feel that it’s worth following if I never come in sight of the Grail,"" said the Poet . It’s our joke on a world that regards us with suspicion that, when we wear our singing robes into the great labor houses, we are really more practical than the men who spend their days there . The question at issue is whether you shall break with the ‘Ch ""I get down on my knees to them,"" says Poet Fulton . ""Success is far from spelling greatness; it takes a great soul to find success and happiness in defeat,"" he says . There’s a poet who sees her paddling her canoe or playing tennis near an inn . I was assigned to the Country Club to do a tennis tournament last fall, and I saw her there . My business was to write a newspaper story about the game, and being a reporter I made myself small on the side lines and kept score . I’ve gone the lengths of realism in trying to describe her . The Poet had not overpraised Fulton’s verses; they were unusual, clean-cut, fresh, and informed with a haunting music . Midnight found him absorbed in a poem he had carried in his heart for days . The lines breathed atmosphere; the descriptive phrases adumbrated the lonely farmhouse with its simple comforts as a stage for the disclosure of a The Poet turned back to the date: only seven years ago! He gained his destinations by good luck rather than by intention . The affairs that men busied themselves with were incomprehensible to him . He suffered himself to be shot skyward in a tall office building . Miles Redfield's manifestations of pleasure continued as he ushered the Poet into his private office . It was with a sense of satisfaction and relief that he soon found himself seated in a mahogany chair by a broad window . Redfield threw himself back in his chair and knit his hands behind his head to emphasize his protestations of idleness . Miles Redfield was a trifle stouter than he had been in the days of intimacy . In spite of the changes of seven years, concretely expressed in the ""Investment Securities"" on the outer door, the Poet concluded that much remained of Redfield . He was still a handsome fellow, not over thirty-five . ""I passed your old house this afternoon,"" the Poet observed casually . ""I was out getting a breath of country air and came in through Marston"" ""I remember that afternoon perfectly--and the sonnet,"" he said . The Poet, for the first time in his life, took advantage of his reputation . Redfield, on his side, knew that it was impossible to evict the best-loved man in the Commonwealth . He swung himself round in his chair, hoping that this utterance would deflect the discussion into more comfortable channels . I owe something to the rest of Us; I can’t afford to stand by and see the little fringes I’ve tacked on to old fabrics torn off without making a protest . To put it another way, I’m not going to have it said that the gulf is so widening between poetry and life that another generation will be asking what our rhymed patter was It's not fair to the child; it’s fair to Elizabeth . It’s contemptible; it won’t do!” said Redfield angrily . “Just how did it begin?” the Poet interrupted. “Well, it began with money--not debts, strange to say, but the other way around! It looked bigger than a million, I can tell you . a man who has shaken his wife and child isn’t prospering in spite of her . Elizabeth insisted on being unhappy about _that_ when she moved into town . The Poet resented even more the leer that had written itself in Redfield’s face . “I’ve always been square with Elizabeth, and you know it! If there’s any scandalous gossip of that kind afloat it’s damnably unjust! I’m sorry!” said the Poet . “The spring was unusually fine,” Redfield sighed his relief . Mrs. Waring was bound for Waupegan to take possession of her house . ""I’m going fishing, and you have scorned all my invitations,"" the Poet said . She said: ""If there ever was a brute-- I can’t imagine it!"" Marian is a much more practical girl than Elizabeth; I don’t see her receiving messages from the Muses with more than chilly politeness . A blow like that falling so close to Elizabeth is bound to have its effect . You may be sure she will profit by Elizabeth’s experience . I’m making a journey, on a very hot afternoon, that I should never have thought of making if it hadn’t been for your cynical remarks . I’ve taken employment as an agent of Providence, just to prove to you that my little preachments in rhyme are not altogether what our young people call piffle . ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself to make sport of  She was a capital mimic and had been a star in amateur theatricals . She had been married at twenty, and to the Poet’s eyes she seemed little older now . He had been wondering how he had ever dared go as far in meddling with other people’s affairs . PART TWO V Marian and Marjorie had built a house of sand on a strip of shaded beach . By the fraudulent use of sticks and stones they had made it stand in violation of all physical laws . When the knights come riding, she must be waiting, haughty and proud, in the great hall to meet them . Marjorie thought a stable should be built for the knights’ horses . Marian's eyes rested dreamily upon distant prospects . The sandy beach lay only a short distance from Mrs. Waring’s house . Poet All the People Loved was not greatly given to the invoking of gods and goddesses; and this was not his stroke--unless he were playing some practical joke . Marjorie, uninterested in letters, attacked with renewed zeal the problem of housing the knights’ horses, while Marian opened the long envelope and drew out half a dozen blue onion A series of quatrains, under the caption “In September,” described the many-named goddess as the unknown poet had observed her in her canoe at night:-- I watched her steady blade Flash in the path the moon had made, And saw the stars on silvery ripples Shine clear and dance and faint and fade . There were many girls who played capital tennis, or who were quite capable of Ums was told to appear here at ten o’clock, sharp, by a gentleman I paddled over from the village and left on Mrs. Waring’s dock an hour ago . Marian, who had risen and was brushing the sand from her skirt, now spoke for the first time . ""The ways of the Poet are inscrutable,"" observed Marian . Frederick Fulton was of a more heroic mould; she thought it quite likely that he could shoulder his canoe and march off with it if it pleased him to do so . He looked capable of doing many things besides scribbling verses, as his ready smile assured her, but seemed satisfied to let her prescribe terms of their acquaintance . Marian grew up and went to the State Agricultural School--to fit me for a literary career! ""I’ve never seen you,"" Marian said . ""A great deal can happen in a week,"" she remarked absently . ""I should hasten to return it before it withered! My little experiments in rhyme are not of the wreath-winning kind."" ""Yards!"" he confessed shamelessly . It seemed like a commentary on her critical judgment which had found them good . ""Of course our Poet has the power to move people like that,"" murmured Marian . The Bible is full of poetry, but it has lost its hold on the people . It’s like an outworn sun that no longer lights and warms the world . There’s a difference between the Bible as a fetish and a working plan for daily use . The apostles themselves didn’t do much better than that! Marian and Fred stared at the lake until the silence became oppressive . ""You have confessed to yards of verses,"" she began, gathering up a handful of sand . His indifference to the opening she had made for him piqued her . Poet scribbled seven stanzas on that little incident . She was not used to being treated in this fashion . Even his manner of asking her pardon for his temerariousness had lacked . Marjorie promised to take her canoeing to a place where people saw fairies they must never tell any one . ""The Poet will think I’ve fallen into the lake,"" he remarked presently . The height of the sun proclaims the luncheon hour . I suppose Miles is right in saying that I have no ambition, that I had become merely a drag on him, and I can see his side of it . The Poet preferred to be amused by this. The obnoxious persons were strangers to him; he had merely heard of them . Farnam doesn’t carry his philanthropy into his business affairs . He’s quite capable of eating lobster to-night and to-morrow morning exacting the last ounce of flesh from the man who paid for it . At any rate, Marjorie and I are not dragging him down! You and Miles have been an ideal of mine . You were like a mariner who doesn’t question his charts when the sea is calm, but who begins to doubt them when he hears the breakers roaring on hidden reefs . I’m going to tell you something that may surprise you . “I know you mean to be kind, and I know it wasn’t easy for you to come to me!” he assented readily . Think how a reconciliation would dull the knives of the expectant cynics and hearten the good people--and they are the majority, after all-who want to see the gospel of happiness and love rule this good old world . The Poet spoke of his house of dreams--_her_ house with its old-fashioned garden . She was half-persuaded that he was really a sad, unobtrusive of men . He walked to the veranda rail and scanned the limpid water . ""That looks like the boy I sent to do my fishing for me,"" he said  VII The Poet was amusing himself the next afternoon with a book of Scotch ballads . Fulton found him with his back against a big beech, apparently established for all time . ""I telephoned down to the office last night and arranged to take my vacation now,"" Fulton said . The Poet had not applauded Fulton’s determination not to ally himself with Redfield . “I’ve decided to keep trying for five years, whether I ever make a killing or not” Fulton replied quietly, and waited for a sign . We must be careful what we put into print; we never can tell who’s going to be influenced by what we write . There’s too much of that sort of thing, but there’s not much sense in handing a child the hot end of a poker just to make it dread the fire . I’m a believer in the inevitable hour and the inevitable word . The Poet was the coolest person in town when he was a visiting statesman . he drew an envelope from his pocket as he tried to grasp this astonishing news . ""Send it back! Why, they’ve sent me back dozens of better pieces! And if it hadn’t been for you--Why,"" he blurted . Poet's attention seemed to wander, and he suppressed a smile with difficulty . ""I’d rather got off the romantic note I started with and there were a dozen dead, pallid pages right in the middle of the thing,"" remarked Fulton . IX As September waned, Fulton heard disquieting news touching Redfield . It was whispered in business circles that the broker had sold stock in a local industrial venture . The story was well calculated to injure if it didn’t at once destroy Redfield’s chances of success as a dealer in securities . The Poet pondered old poems rather than new ones . ""To-morrow is All-Children’s Day,"" remarked Fulton a few days later . Marian and Marjorie were engaged with utmost seriousness . The Poet rose, picked up a magazine from the center table, scanned the table of contents, and then said, very quietly,-- “Miles is in trouble.” He then proceeded quickly: “What Miles does or what he becomes is of no interest to me,” she answered sharply . “He’s down and out; there’s no possibility of his going on with X Indirection as a method and means to ends has its disadvantages; but it is not to be scorned utterly . It’s the height of cowardice to give up and persuade yourself that you’ve exhausted the subject in a quatrain . There’s a fine courage in Miles; unless I’ve mistaken him,  I had hard work to persuade Mrs. Redfield to come and bring Marjorie . I fell back heavily on your argument that marjorie should have a final picnic before the turn o’ the year . ""I should hope so!"" cried Marian approvingly . ""You do my orchardist hero a cruel injustice,"" protested Fulton, ""for he saw only one girl--and a very nice girl she was--or is!"" ""Let’s all go out and see the sun go down,"" she said . The Poet joined with Marian and Fulton in praising the banners of purple and gold that were flung across the west, while Marjorie tugged at his umbrella .

"The Wide, Wide World"," The Wide, Wide World is a work of sentimentalism based on the life of young Ellen Montgomery. The story begins with Ellen’s happy life being disrupted by the fact that her mother is very ill and her father must take her to Europe, requiring Ellen to leave home to live with an almost-unknown aunt. Though Ellen tries to act strong for her mother’s sake, she is devastated and can find solace in nothing. Eventually the day comes when Ellen must say goodbye to her mother and travel in the company of strangers to her aunt’s home. Unfortunately these strangers are unkind to Ellen and she tries to leave the boat on which they are traveling. An old man sees Ellen crying and tells her to trust in God. He teaches her about being a Christian, as her mother had done, and asks her if she is ready to give her heart to Jesus. After talking with the man, Ellen becomes determined to become a true Christian, which gives her strength for the rest of the journey to her aunt’s place in Thirwall. On Ellen’s first night in Thirwall, she learns that her father forgot to inform her aunt that she was coming, so a ""Mr. Van Brunt"" escorts her to her aunt's home. This aunt, Fortune Emerson, proves to be quite different from Ellen's loving mother: she treats Ellen unkindly and refuses to let her attend school. Ellen hates living with Fortune and comes to find comfort in the society of Mr. Van Brunt and other neighbors as she becomes more familiar with her new surroundings. One day, discovering that her aunt withheld a letter from Mrs. Montgomery, Ellen runs crying into the woods. There she meets Alice Humphreys, the daughter of a local minister. Alice is kind of Ellen and invites her to tea the next day, to give Ellen a chance to tell her troubles; maybe Alice would be able to help. The girls become fast friends and Alice adopts Ellen as a sister, offering to educate her and guide her spiritually, teaching her to forgive others and trust in the Lord. Alice and her brother John, who is away at school much of the time, treat Ellen like family, even inviting her to spend Christmas in the nearby town of Ventnor with them and their friends, the Marshmans. While there, Ellen meets another Ellen, Ellen Chauncey. She also gets better acquainted with John Humphreys, who comforts her many times after the other children tease her. Ellen comes to realize that if she hadn't needed to be separated from her mother, she might never have met Alice and John. About a year later, one day when Ellen visits town, she overhears from some ladies' conversation that her mother has died. Devastated, she turns to Alice and her Bible for comfort. She stays with Alice and John until Aunt Fortune becomes ill and Ellen must look after her. Eventually Aunt Fortune recovers and Ellen returns to Alice and her other friends. After Mr. Van Brunt’s mother dies, he decides to marry Aunt Fortune; soon after, Alice tells Ellen that she is very ill and will soon be ""going home"" to Heaven; Ellen is not to grieve for her but to trust in God. She also invites Ellen to take her place in the Humphreys household. Ellen immediately moves in and begins by nursing Alice through her final weeks. After Alice dies, Ellen turns to John for guidance. He takes over as her tutor, spiritual advisor, and guiding light. By the time a Humphreys relative dies in England and John must travel overseas to handle the family's business, Ellen (though sad to see him go) is a stronger person. One day Nancy visits Ellen, bringing letters she has found while cleaning Fortune's house. They are for Ellen from her mother and express the wish that Ellen go live with relatives in Scotland; after sharing the letters with Mr. Humphreys, Ellen decides she must honor her parents' wishes so the Humphreys send her to Scotland to live with the Lindsays: her grandmother and uncle Lindsay and Lady Keith. They welcome her into their home and find her delightful, but they become very possessive of her and force her to denounce her identity as an American and as a Montgomery. Mr. Lindsay even makes Ellen call him “father” and refers to her as his “own little daughter.” The Lindsays also discourage Ellen’s faith, as they don’t see religion as being important to someone Ellen’s age. Ellen finds it hard to live without her daily hours set aside for studying religion, but still tries hard to live by her faith and everything that John and Alice taught her. Ellen misses John more than anything, and during a New Year’s Eve party at the Lindsays', he shows up asking for her. The Lindsays try to keep them apart, but they are unsuccessful. During their emotional reunion John reminds Ellen to keep her faith; in a few years, when she will be able to choose where she lives, she can return to America and live with him. When Ellen introduces John to the Lindsays, they actually become fond of him. John must soon return to America, but not without promising Ellen that they will be together forever soon. In an unpublished chapter at the end of the book, Ellen returns to America as Mrs. John Humphreys.

The Moneychangers," As the novel begins, the position of CEO of one of America's largest banks, First Mercantile American (very loosely based on the Bank of America, although it is located in an unnamed Midwestern city) is about to become vacant due to the terminal illness of Ben Roselli, the incumbent chief, whose grandfather founded the bank. Two high-ranking executives groomed for the succession begin their personal combat for the position. One, Alex Vandervoort, is honest, hard-charging, and focused on growing FMA through retail banking and embracing emerging technology; the other, Roscoe Heyward, is suave, hypocritical, and skilled in boardroom politics, and favors catering more to business than to consumers. Many characters and plot lines interweave. Senior bank teller Miles Eastin is discovered to be defrauding the bank whilst casting guilt on another teller, a young single mother. He is dismissed, arrested, and convicted. In prison, his knowledge of counterfeiting brings him to the attention of a gang of credit card forgers, who give him a job on his release. As an affiliate of the forgers, he secretly reports back to the bank's Head of Security; he is discovered and tortured, to be rescued in the nick of time. As readers increasingly appreciate Vandervoort, the protagonist, they learn of his troubled personal life. His advancement in banking circles has come as his marriage is failing; his wife is confined to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Vandervoort is shown as having developed a relationship with Margot Bracken, who is depicted as a radical attorney and political activist many years his junior; her attitudes sometime conflicts with Vandervoort's role at FMA. Meanwhile, Vandervoort's antagonist, Hayward, is depicted as a devout Episcopalian who strives to maintain an air of personal integrity and morality, only to slowly sacrifice them both in his pursuit of the presidency of FMA. As these men pursue their battle for the soon-to-be-vacant position of CEO, various issues involving the banking industry, such as credit card fraud, embezzlement, inflation, subprime lending, and insider trading are discussed. First Mercantile American is eventually revealed to have a doppelganger in the form of an organized crime family. The fight for control of the bank continues under the darkening clouds of an approaching economic recession. One of the two CEO contenders is brought down for his role in making a large loan to a dishonest multinational conglomerate (loosely based on International Telephone and Telegraph) that goes into default. The ensuing scandal causes a bank run and panic among depositors, shareholders, and employees, with the perpetrator committing suicide rather than face the consequences of his actions. The other candidate assumes the position of CEO of the half-ruined bank.

""I suppose he wants to buy my Northern Mississippi stock,"" he said to himself . The Ryder paused for a moment, to let this information sink into his auditor's mind . ""What I wished to see you about, Mr. Montague, was ""Whatever you tell me will, of course, be confidential,"" said Montague . ""I can see no reason why I shouldn't,"" Montaguue answered . The Mr. Montague, this is a project to extend a railroad which will be of vast service to the chief competitor of the Steel Trust . In these and a hundred other ways ""I appreciate your confidence, Mr. Ryder, and what you say appeals to me,"" said Montague .

Across on the other side of the mill was Andrews Montague arrived on a Friday afternoon, and found that Alice had departed for her visit to the Prentices', and that Oliver was in Newport, also . Montague had seen the social splurge in the Metropolis, and had heard the fabulous prices that people had paid for things .

Major Venable had hinted that the Coal Trust would not consider it The great ladies of Society were adepts in this art, and prided themselves upon the perfect system which enabled them to accomplish it . It chanced to be the evening of Mrs. Landis Mr. Gamble was clad in a spotless yachting costume, which produced a most comical effect upon his expansive person . ""How do you do, Mr. Montag Montague thought of this remark at lunch, where he sat at table on opposite side to Gamble .

Even at that early hour there were crowds in the financial district .

The Magic of Oz," At the top of Mount Munch, lives a group of people known as the Hyups. One of their numbers, a Munchkin named Bini Aru, discovered a method of transforming people and objects by merely saying the word ""Pyrzqxgl"". After Princess Ozma decreed that no one could practice magic in Oz except for Glinda the Good Witch and the Wizard of Oz, Bini wrote down the directions for pronouncing ""Pyrzqxgl"" and hid them in his magical laboratory. When Bini and his wife are at a fair one day, their son Kiki Aru, who thirsts for adventure, finds the directions and afterwards transforms himself into a hawk and visits various countries outside the land of Oz. When he alights in the land of Ev, Kiki Aru learns that he needs money to pay for a night's lodging (versus Oz, where money is not used at all) and changes himself into a magpie to steal a gold piece from an old man. A sparrow confronts the then-human Kiki Aru with knowledge of the theft, and Kiki says that he did not know what it was like to be wicked before, he is glad that he is now. This conversation is overheard by Ruggedo, the Nome who was exiled to the Earth's surface in Tik-Tok of Oz, and he sees through Kiki Aru's power a chance to get revenge on the people of Oz. Kiki changes himself and Ruggedo into birds and they fly over the Deadly Desert into the Land of Oz. They enter Oz as animals to escape detection by Glinda and to recruit an army of conquest from the country's wild animal population. When they first appear in the Forest of Gugu in the Gillikin Country, Kiki changes himself and Ruggedo into Li-Mon-Eags (fictional creatures with the heads of lions, the bodies of monkeys, and the wings of eagles as well as having the tails of donkeys) and lies that they've seen the people of the Emerald City plan to enslave the animal inhabitants of the Forest. Ruggedo claims that they the Li-Mon-Eags will transform the animals into humans and march on the Emerald City and transform its inhabitants into animals, driving them into the forest. Ruggedo proves their power (for Kiki's the only one who knows ""Pyrzqxgl"") by having Kiki transform one of the leopard king Gugu's advisors, Loo the unicorn, into a man and back again. Gugu offers to meet with the leaders of the other animal tribes to decide on this matter of invasion. Dorothy and the Wizard arrive with the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger in the Forest of Gugu during this council of war with a request for monkeys to train in time for Ozma's upcoming birthday party. Ruggedo recognizes his old enemies and inspires Kiki to begin transforming people and animals left and right &mdash; including Ruggedo, whom Kiki turns against by transforming him into a goose, a transformation that the Nomes most fears because as a goose he might lay an egg. The Wizard, whom Kiki transformed into a fox, follows the Li-Mon-Eag with his magic bag, the transformed Kiki, deep into the forest where he begins transforming monkeys into giant human soldiers. However, Kiki makes them so big that they cannot move through the trees. The Wizard, however, heard how to correctly pronounce ""Pyrzqxgl"" and first stops Kiki and Ruggedo by transforming them into a walnut and a hickory nut. Then the Wizard resumes his rightful form and changes Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, and Gugu back to their forms, and he agrees to change the soldiers back into monkeys. The Wizard recruits several of the grateful monkeys and shrinks them down to bring back to the Emerald City and train. On arriving there, Dorothy and the Wizard are dispatched to a magic island where Cap'n Bill and Trot went to get a magic flower for Ozma's birthday. However, the island itself causes anything living that touches it to take root there, and that is how the sailor and his friend are found when Dorothy and the Wizard arrive. The Wizard uses ""Pyrzqxgl"" to change Cap'n Bill and Trot into honeybees which narrowly avoid being eaten by the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger. When they are human again, Cap'n Bill retrieves the flower by strapping a wood plank onto his good leg, walks with that and his wooden leg onto the island, and retrieves the flower. Back at the Emerald City, Ozma and her friends celebrate her birthday (though without quite the pomp and fanfare from The Road to Oz) and then decide how to deal with the evil magicians transformed into nuts. The Wizard uses ""Pyrzqxgl"" to change them back to Kiki Aru and Ruggedo and make them thirsty enough to drink the Water of Oblivion, which will make them forget all that they have ever known. The now-blank slate Kiki Aru and Ruggedo will live in the Emerald City and learn to be good and kind.

Frank Baum Posting Date: July 20, 2008 [EBook #419] Release Date: February, 1996 Language: English Character set encoding: ASCII *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAGIC OF OZ  Bini Aru, a wise old Hyup, was a clever Sorcerer . He had never seen Glinda the Good and the Wizard of Oz . By its means, it was the simplest thing in the world to transform anyone into beast, bird or fish . Bini Aru discovered the secret of instant transformation, which required no tools or chemicals or herbs and always worked perfectly . After giving the matter careful thought, he decided to write the word, and how it should be pronounced, in some secret place, so that he could find it after many years . Kiki Aru was just about to replace the board when it slipped from his hand and turned over . The light was rather dim, so he took the board to the window and examined it, and found that the writing described exactly how to pronounce the magic word Pyrzqxgl . After The Hawk Even a hawk has to fly high in order to cross the Deadly Desert . Kiki Aru felt sick and faint by the time he reached good land again . From his tree-top he could see a house near by, which looked very comfortable . Kiki Aru flew westward into the Kingdom of Ix . After a day in Queen Zixi's country, he went on westward to the Land of Ev . ""You can if you have the money to pay,"" said the man, ""otherwise you must go Two Bad Ones Kiki turned around and saw a queer old man standing near . ""I didn't know you were here,"" said Kiki . The Nome King gave him a shrewd look . Kiki said: ""I'm afraid of 'em; ""Are they better than gold pieces?"" asked the old Nome . ""I'll give you TWO pocketsful of jewels,"" said Kiki Aru . Kiki realized that to share his power with another would be dangerous to himself . ""I'll tell you what I'll do. If you will help me to conquer Oz,"" says the Nome . ""I will make YOU the Ruler of all Oz, and I will be your Prime Minister,"" says Kiki . The Nome was so furious at this refusal that he ""Two birds couldn't conquer the Land of Oz,"" says Ruggedo the Nome . ""I think you can transform us into beasts as well as birds,"" retorted Kiki . if we fly into the country as birds, Glinda won't know anything ""It is impossible to kill anyone in the Land of Oz,"" said Kiki Aru . ""I'm afraid I don't understand you,"" objected the boy . Ruggedo promised himself that as soon as they had conquered Oz, he would transform the old Nome into Ruggedo thought he was fooling Kiki; so both were pleased . ""It's a long way across the Desert,"" remarked the boy . The former Nome King agreed to this, and the two spent the rest of that day talking over their plans . Ozma's Royal Palace is the most splendid building ever constructed . From a hundred towers and domes floated the banners of Oz, which included the Ozmies, the Munchkins, the Gillikins, and the Quadlings . The fairyland of Oz is so big ""I've been wondering what I could give here as a birthday present,"" says Trot . ""I know, too, what I can give Ozma,"" Trot says . The Glass Cat is one of the most curious creatures in all Oz . Ozma had forbidden her subjects to work magic, but the Glass Cat refused to catch mice . This astonished cat was made all of glass and was so transparent that you could see through it as easily as through a window . ""You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,"" said Cap'n Bill Ozma's Birthday Presents When Cap'n Bill and Trot started for the hidden island in the far-off river to get the Magic Flower . ""I've written a song for her,"" answered the Patchwork Girl, who went by the name of ""Scraps"" ""I Ozma has always admired my straw filling, so I'm sure she'll be pleased with these lovely straw slippers . ""You'll have to THINK, Dorothy,"" said the Scarecrow of Oz . Dorothy asked her: ""What would it be to give Ozm Ozma herself had brought this wooden horse to life . She had shod the bottoms of its wooden legs with plates of gold so they wouldn't wear out . The Sawhorse was a swift and willing traveler, and it seldom said anything unless spoken to . ""Nothing is nicer for a birthday,"" says the Sorceress . ""A cake doesn't seem like much of a present,"" says Dorothy . The Wizard of Oz was a little man with a bald head and sharp eyes and a round, jolly face  ""That's where you're to help me,"" says the Wizard . ""You and I will go there, and we'll get some of the big monkeys,"" says Dorothy . Ozma's birthday will be a surprise for her birthday, and she mustn't know where we Gugu Forest is the home of most of the wild beasts that inhabit Oz . They are seldom disturbed in their leafy haunts because there is no reason why Oz people should go there . The biggest beasts inhabit the great forest, while the smaller ones live mostly in the mountain underbrush at the east  ""There are enough beasts right here to enable us to conquer the people of Oz,"" says the Nome . ""I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?"" asks Ruggedo, who is born in the Land of Oz, ""nothing can hurt me"" ""You must transform us while The Li-Mon-Eags Make Trouble There had been trouble in the Forest of Gugu that morning . Chipo the Wild Boar had bitten the tail off Arx the Giraffe while the latter had his head among the leaves of a tree . Tirrip knew it was the ""You strange Li-Mon-Eag--you mixed-up beast who are neither one thing nor another"" ""I wouldn't lie for the world; I--"" ""Silence!"" again growled Gugu the King . ""Why, I can fly, you know, having the ""If you fail, we will destroy you,"" said Ruggedo . ""I'm tired, so I'll let my comrade make the transformation,"" said the Nome . The King of Beasts now addressed the King in a more friendly tone . ""You'd better make me a Unicorn again,"" says Ruggedo the Nome . ""I will have my revenge on Ozma and Dorothy and all the rest of my enemies,"" he said . The Glass Cat led Trot and Cap'n Bill by straight and easy paths . ""I wonder,"" says Trot, ""if MY brains whirl around in the same way yours do"" Cap'n Bill was disturbed by sounds from the forest, but no beast attacked them . At daybreak they reached the bank of a river, but it gradually broadened . Cap'n Bill sat down on a log and gazed at the Island of the Magic Flower . ""I saw two Kalidahs on this very bank, where they had come to drink,"" remarked the Glass Cat . Trot jumped up, greatly frightened, Cap'n Bill knew he could not kill the Kalidah, for no living thing in Oz can be killed . ""I think you think you're clever, to pin me to the ground in this manner,"" he told Trot . When they do come, you can't escape them ""I've been to the Magic Isle,"" said the Glass Cat . ""I don't care,"" the beast replied in a surly tone . Cap'n Bill pushed the raft into the water and fastened it together . ""I seem stuck, Trot,"" Cap'n Bill says . ""This is funny!"" she exclaimed. ""What do you 'spose has happened to us,"" he said . The Glass Cat, which was walking around as naturally as ever, said: ""Your foot has got roots to Trot and Cap'n Bill entered the forest and trotted along a secret path . ""We're livin' in a magic country, but neither of us knows any magic an' so we can't help ourselves,"" Trot said . Trot puffed out the smoke The Beasts of the Forest of Gugu That was a wonderful gathering of wild animals . Rango, the Gray Ape, had even called his monkey sentinels away from the forest edge . Back of the beasts were the pumas, jaguars, tigers and lions ""Beasts of the Forest of Gugu,"" began Ruggedo the Nome, ""my comrade and I are your friends. We are magicians, and from our home in the sky we can look down into the Land of Oz and see everything that is going on"" Ozma, who rules ""The Oz people are fairies, and you can't fight against magic unless you also have magic,"" said Ruggedo the Nome . ""My plan is simple,"" replied the Nomes, and the other beasts echoed his words, crying: ""Tell us your plan!"" ""You Kiki uses His Magic Then arose a great confusion of sounds as all the animals began talking to their fellows . Ruggedo the Nome waved his arms and fluttered his wings to try to make them listen to him again, but the beasts paid no attention . Gugu ""I am always hungry for fat babies,"" asked Loo the Unicorn . Ruggedo the Nome was frightened, but realized that his conscience won't let him eat babies . ""We have known you many years ago, so we know you are the King of all Beasts,"" Kiki Aru had found a place, near to the point where he stood, where there was a deep hollow in the rock . The Wizard suddenly felt his form change to that of a fox, and his black bag fell to the ground . Ruggedo the Nome saw what was Gugu the King crouched on the rock's edge and was about to spring on the boy . From his tree Kiki transformed Gugu into a fat Gillikin woman . They were so quick that they could only look at one another in a dazed and helpless fashion . ""Let's look and see if we can find it,"" suggested Dorothy the Lamb . The Goose searched as earnestly as the others, for if he could find it . Ruggedo the Nome was not really sorry, now that he thought about it, that Kiki had ""I'm afraid it's too late, now,"" says Dorothy, regretfully . ""You're nice and fuzzy,"" says the Cowardly Lion . Trot and Cap'n Bill were its friends and so was disturbed at the fix it had gotten them into . Glass Cat traveled through the Great Forest of Gugu many times in its journeys through the Land of Oz . When the Glass Cat reached the clearing, it saw a Fox, a Lamb, Rabbit, Munchkin boy and a fat Gillikin woman wandering around in an aimless way  ""I'm Dorothy,"" says the Lamb . The Glass Cat sat on its hind legs and began to laugh . ""That Magician must look funnier than you do,"" the Lamb says . The Wizard learns the Magic Word Now, the Goose was the transformation of old Ruggedo the Nome . The Nome detested anything in the way of a bird, because birds lay eggs and eggs are feared by all the Nomes more than anything else in the world . A goose is  Old Ruggedo muttered to himself: ""I will be gentle with him now, and fierce with him when I have him in my power"" ""You bungled things, as I said, but we can still conquer Oz,"" Kiki said . ""Because those monkeys are to be our ""Nothing can kill the Oz people,"" said Ruggedo the Nome . ""No, you have frightened the beasts, and they would no longer consent to assist us in conquering Oz,"" he said . Kiki spied a hollow tree in which the Wizard of Kiki Aru the Hyup disappeared and a small hickory-nut rolled upon the ground . The Nome saw the Fox but no Kiki, so he hastily rose to his feet . But the Wizard Fox had heard quite plainly every word that he had said ""I want my own form again--Pyrzqxgl!"" uttered Dorothy the Lamb . The Magician transformed the two Li-Mon-Eags into shapes that could not speak . Cap'n Bill and Lonesome Duck Trot stood before the Magic Trot plucked a peach from the bush and began to eat it . ""Grab one, Cap'n!"" exclaimed Trot, and even while eating the peach she seized a banana with her other hand . The old sailor was still bewildered . ""I'm not a fairy or a wizard or any kind of a magic-maker,"" says Cap'n Bill . ""I ain't complainin',"" says the sailor-man . The bird swam swiftly and gracefully toward the Magic Isle ""You'll keep growing smaller every day, until bye and bye there'll be nothing left of you,"" says Cap'n Bill . ""I've lived a long time, and I've got to live forever, because I belong in the Land of Oz,"" says the Lonesome Lonesome Duck waddled about in a small circle, waddling backward three times and forward three times . ""If you get TOO disagreeable, you'll drive me away before I finish this incantation,"" said Cap'n Bill . The sailor-man found  Rango the Gray Ape was the Chief of all the monkey tribes of the forest . Rango realized that the magician who looked like a mixed-up beast was responsible for the transformations . He hurried away to the Great Clearing to tell Gugu the King what had happened . O Rango the Gray Ape took some monkeys to Emerald City for Ozma's birthday cake . The Glass Cat climbed the tree to its very top and saw the giants' heads . ""I forgot to tell you,"" said the Glass Cat. ""Why didn't you tell me before ""Don't you admire my pink brains?"" asked the Glass Cat . ""Well, I'll admit they're better HUNTERS,"" said the Wizard, reluctantly . Now that he had regained his Magic Tools, he felt confident he could rescue Trot and Cap ""Why should I?"" says the Gray Ape . ""If you will treat the twelve monkeys nicely and bring them safely back to the forest, I'll let you take them"" ""We'll go at once and save those giant soldiers,"" says Dorothy . The Wizard of Oz and Princess Dorothy enter the Forest of Gugu hereafter . They will be as welcome and safe with us as ever they are in the Emerald City . ""I know all the Land of Oz better than any other living creature knows it,"" says the Glass Cat . ""The Magic Isle is in this forest,"" says the Glass Cat . ""I know we shall reach the river if we go east through the forest,"" said the Wizard . The Glass Cat started away, and at first it was easy to pass between the trees . ""I know 'em, and they're stuck fast, all right. You may as well go back home, for no power can save them,"" says Dorothy . ""I'm the great Forest Magician, as any beast can tell you, but even I have no power to destroy the  Trot and Cap'n Bill arrived at a place just opposite the Magic Isle . ""No, I don't think the Lonesome Duck was right in saying no magic can rescue them?"" asked Trot in a worried tone of voice . Trot said: ""I'll do my best Trot and Cap'n Bill tried to move their feet and failed . Trot's feet were still rooted in the ground of the Magic Isle . ""I'm 'fraid we'll have to go to Glinda, after all,"" he said . The Wizard paddled the raft across the water and ran it upon the beach of the Magic Isle . ""If you can't save us soon, there'll be nothing left of us,"" advises Cap'n Bill . Trot said to her friends: ""It would hurt us awfully"" Trot and Cap'n Bill flew two bumblebees on the Magic Isle . The Wizard pronounced the Magic Word in the right way . ""They're so small that you never can tell what might happen to 'em,"" said Trot . Cap'n Bill shook hands with the Wizard and congratulated him on his escape . ""I hate to be stumped,"" said Trot, with evident disapproval . Trot: ""I noticed my wooden leg didn't get stuck, or take root, an' Cap'n Bill picked up the Magic Flower and set it down very gently . ""I guess the Magician who put it on the island never thought that any one would carry it off,"" says Dorothy . Trot: ""If it falls off, it might get smashed an' be ruined"" Trot and Dorothy could ride on the back of the Hungry Tiger, and between them they carried the cage of monkeys . The Glass Cat grumbled because it would take so long to get to the Emerald City . By means of his magic the Wizard created three tents, pitched in a row The Glass Cat stole near the cage and gave a yank to one of the tails . After whispering together they let their tails stick out and all remained quiet . Dorothy and Trot were horrified, but the Wizard shook his head and said it served the Glass Cat right for ""This is only part of your punishment,"" says the Wizard, severely .

Heart of Darkness," 'Heart of Darkness' opens in first person narrative; our narrator establishes the setting aboard a sailboat, ""The Nellie, a cruising yawl,"" anchored in the Thames River near Gravesend (England). It is somewhat hazy and late in the day. Aboard are four others: the Director of Companies (the captain), the Lawyer (""the best of old fellows""), the Accountant (toying architecturally with dominoes), and Marlow (Charlie Marlow) - all share ""the bond of the sea"" but Marlow is the only one that still ""followed the sea"" - they are waiting for the tide waters to turn. Some undefined conversation is shared lazily, the sun sets; then Marlow states how their location also ""has been one of the dark places of the earth."" Marlow continues describing the trials and tribulations that must have been encountered by the first Romans who made their way to England; how mysterious and incomprehensible the place must have seemed to them. He also explains how brutal and unscrupulous these Romans must have been: ""They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force"" - After some silence, Marlow abruptly starts up again saying, in a hesitating voice, ""I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit."" Marlow introduces the events that led to his appointment to captain a river-steamboat for an ivory trading company. He describes his passage on ships to the wilderness - to the Company's station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation: ""amongst a waste of excavations"" - disorganized, machinery parts here and there, now and then explosions of demolition, weakened native black men, that have been demoralized, in chains, literally being worked to death, and strolling behind them a white Company man in a uniform carrying a rifle. Marlow remarks on these Company men: ""I've seen the devil of violence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by all the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed and drove men—men, I tell you. But as I stood on this hillside, I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly. How insidious he could be, too, I was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther."" At this station Marlow meets the Company's chief accountant, who's dressed in ""unexpected elegance"" - ""Everything else in the station was in a muddle"" - Marlow first hears of a Mr. Kurtz from the chief accountant, who explains that Kurtz is a first-class agent, and later adds: ""'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above—the Council in Europe, you know—mean him to be.'"" Marlow leaves that station with a caravan to travel on foot some two hundred miles deeper into the wilderness - to the Central Station, where his steamboat is based - the steamer he is to captain. Upon arrival at the Central Station: ""the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show."" Marlow is shocked to learn that his steamboat had been wrecked two days before his arrival. The manager explains to Marlow that they couldn't wait, and needed to take the steamboat up-river because of ""rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill."" Marlow describes that the manager ""inspired uneasiness"" - ""just uneasiness—nothing more"" - Along with the manager, Marlow describes the other Company men at this station as lazy back-biting ""pilgrims"" - fraught with envy and jealousy. All trying to better position themselves in a way to acquire a higher status within the Company, which in turn, would carry more personal profit; but sought after such goals in a meaningless ineffective lazy manner, mixed with a sense that they were all merely waiting, while trying to stay out of harm's way. After fishing his command out of the river, frustrations are met during the months spent on repairs. During this time, Marlow learns that at this station Mr. Kurtz is far from being admired, but instead, more or less, Kurtz is resented (mostly by the manager). Not only is Kurtz's position at the Inner Station a highly envied position, but sentiment seems to be that Kurtz is not deserving of it, as Kurtz only received the appointment by his connections back in Europe. Once ready and underway, the journey up-river to the Inner Station, Kurtz's station, takes two months - to the day. On board was the manager, three or four ""pilgrims"" and about twenty ""cannibals"" that were enlisted to crew the steamer. Marlow describes the brooding wilderness, in all its glory, and in all its mystery. Here and there would be a Company post where Company agents seemed imprisoned, captive by the business of ivory; now and then on shore an occasional native village would be seen, with a frenzied uproar by the natives. Marlow expresses a greater enthusiasm towards the idea of meeting Kurtz - but things become more tense as they get closer to his station. They come to rest for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station. In the morning they awake only to find that they are immersed within a thick white fog. From the river bank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a complaining clamour in savage discords: ""It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short"" - ""The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap."" Many wondered if there would be an attack. But it was not until a few hours onwards, while safe navigation was becoming increasingly difficult, that the steamboat was hit with a barrage of sticks - little arrows, everywhere - aimed at the steamboat from the wilderness on shore. The little arrows ""looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat"" - The pilgrims with their Winchesters had opened fire into the bush. The native who had been serving as helmsman, gave up steering to pick up a rifle and shoot it. Marlow grabs the wheel to avoid snags in the river. The helmsman fell at Marlow's feet clutching a shaft of a spear, which had entered his body just below the ribs. Marlow began to screech the steam whistle repeatedly; ""the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharply—then silence"" - A pilgrim in ""pink pyjamas"" arrives at the pilot-house, and is shocked to see the dying helmsman. They watch the helmsman die with an inexplicable expression on his face. Marlow forces the pilgrim in ""pink pyjamas"" to take the wheel so that he can shed his blood soaked shoes, and while flinging the pair overboard, he is hit with a rush of thoughts; thinking he would never have a chance to hear Kurtz talk, as he is most likely dead - then submits: ""Of course I was wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than enough."" Marlow makes a vague mention of a girl, whom later Kurtz will refer to as ""My Intended"" (his fiancée): ""You should have heard him say, 'My ivory.' Oh, yes, I heard him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my—' everything belonged to him."" Marlow reflects more on Kurtz: ""His mother was half-English, his father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz"" - ""I learned that, most appropriately, the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had entrusted him with the making of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it, too. I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence"" - ""There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases, unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: 'Exterminate all the brutes!' The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of 'my pamphlet' (he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career."" After reflecting more on Kurtz, Marlow states ""I can't forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I missed my late helmsman awfully"" - ""don't you see, he had done something, he had steered"" - ""and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken."" After putting on a pair of slippers, Marlow returned to the pilot-house and resumed steering. By this time the manager is there, and expresses a strong desire to turn back - right at the moment that the Inner Station comes into view. At Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the river-bank waving his arm, urging them to land. Because of his expressions, gestures, and all the colorful patches on his clothing, the man reminds Marlow of a harlequin. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The harlequin-like chap boards the steamboat. It turns out the man is Russian, and he is a mere wanderer; who just happened to wander into Kurtz's camp: ""He rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case. 'Don't you talk with Mr. Kurtz?' I said. 'You don't talk with that man—you listen to him,' he exclaimed with severe exaltation."" - ""'I tell you,' he cried, 'this man has enlarged my mind.'"" Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz could be, how the natives worshiped Kurtz, and how very ill Kurtz has been of late. The concerned harlequin-like Russian admires Mr. Kurtz for his intellect - for his insights - into love, life, and justice. The Russian seems to even admire Kurtz for his power - and his willingness to use it. Marlow suggests that Kurtz has gone mad, and the Russian ""protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn't be mad. If I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn't dare hint at such a thing."" From the steamboat, through a glass (telescope) Marlow can observe details of the station, and is surprised suddenly to see near the station house a row of posts with decapitated heads of natives mounted atop of each. Around the corner of the house the manager with the pilgrims appeared, bearing Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area then filled with natives, who appeared to be ready for battle. The Russian stated: ""'Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for'"" - On the stretcher Marlow could see Kurtz shouting. The pilgrims carried Kurtz to the steamer and laid him down in one of the little cabins. A gorgeous native woman, with a desperate aspect, walked in measured steps along the shore and stopped right next to the steamer. She raised her arms above her head - then ""turned away slowly, walked on, following the bank, and passed into the bushes."" From the steamboat's cabin Kurtz was placed in, he is heard yelling at the manager: ""'Save me!—save the ivory, you mean. Don't tell me. Save me! Why, I've had to save you. You are interrupting my plans now. Sick! Sick! Not so sick as you would like to believe.'"" The manager walks out of the cabin, and spoke with Marlow about ""unsound methods"" and Marlow puts forward the notion: ""No method at all"" - After some more words the manager gives Marlow a heavy glance, then leaves. The Russian mentions ""'matters that would affect Mr. Kurtz's reputation.'"" - Marlow replied to the Russian: ""'Mr. Kurtz's reputation is safe with me.'"" - He informed Marlow ""that it was Kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer"" - The harlequin-like Russian refers to a canoe waiting for him, and adds: ""'Ah! I'll never, never meet such a man again. You ought to have heard him recite poetry—his own, too, it was, he told me. Poetry!' He rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights. 'Oh, he enlarged my mind!' 'Good-bye,' said I. He shook hands and vanished in the night."" Later, after midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin - he has left the steamer, and has returned to shore. Marlow goes ashore and finds Kurtz in a very weak state making his way back to his station - but not so weak, as he can still call out to the natives. Marlow appreciates the serious situation he is in, and when Kurtz begins a threatening tone, Marlow interjects that his ""success in Europe is assured in any case"" - Kurtz agrees to allow Marlow to help him back to the steamer. The next day they prepare for their departure. They carried Kurtz to the pilot-house: ""there was more air there"" - The natives once again assembled on shore, and the native woman returned - they all began to shout. Marlow saw the pilgrims getting their rifles ready - so he screeched the steam whistle time after time to scatter the crowd on shore. Only the woman remained unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims opened fire. The current was swift as they headed downstream. Kurtz's health was worsening. Marlow himself is becoming increasingly ill. The steamboat broke down and repairs needed to be made. Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers with a photograph because of his dislike and mistrust of the manager. While ill, Marlow continued to make the repairs to the steamer: ""I toiled wearily in a wretched scrap-heap—unless I had the shakes too bad to stand."" He did not have much time for Kurtz: ""One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously, 'I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.' The light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur, 'Oh, nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed."" As Kurtz dies, Marlow hears him whisper, in no more than a breath: ""'The horror! The horror!'"" Marlow blew out the candle, and tries to act like nothing has happened when he joins the other pilgrims, who were all in the mess-room dining with the manager. In a short while, the ""manager's boy"" appears and announces in a scathing tone: ""'Mistah Kurtz—he dead.'"" - Next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury ""something"" in a muddy hole. ""And then they very nearly buried me"" - Marlow falls very sick, near death himself: ""I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine"" - ""I was within a hair's breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped over the edge myself, I understand better"" - ""He had summed up—he had judged. 'The horror!' He was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth—the strange commingling of desire and hate"" - ""he had made that last stride, he had stepped over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up would not have been a word of careless contempt. Better his cry—much better."" Upon Marlow's return to Europe he seems embittered. The everyday life of the Europeans seem to be something a sham - like some sort of hoax. Eventually Marlow took care of the bundle of papers Kurtz had entrusted to him. To a clean-shaven man who had an official manner, Marlow gave the paper entitled 'Suppression of Savage Customs' - ""with the postscriptum torn off"" - To another, who claims to be Kurtz's cousin, Marlow gave family letters and memoranda of no importance. To a journalist he gave a Report for publication, if the journalist saw fit. Finally Marlow was left with some personal letters and the photograph of the girl's portrait - Kurtz's fiancée, his intended. At her door, even before Marlow entered her house, memories of Kurtz began to flow, along with the final words that he whispered. The girl came forward, dressed in black, and met Marlow in a drawing-room. Although it has been more than a year since Kurtz died, she was still in mourning. It was late, and the room was growing darker. The final words of Kurtz's seemed to echo in the room with the girl. Marlow envisioned them together: ""I saw her and him in the same instant of time—his death and her sorrow—I saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death."" She presses Marlow for information, ultimately asking him to repeat the final words Kurtz had spoken. Being very uncomfortable Marlow tells her that the final words that Kurtz pronounce was her name. Marlow was surprised by her reaction: ""I heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain. 'I knew it—I was sure!'... She knew. She was sure. I heard her weeping"" - ""I wonder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn't he said he wanted only justice? But I couldn't. I could not tell her. It would have been too dark—too dark altogether...."" Then Marlow and his listeners were silent; our first narrator explains: ""Nobody moved for a time. 'We have lost the first of the ebb,' said the Director suddenly. I raised my head. The offing was barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky—seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.""

""I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Company's chief accountant"" ""I had to wait in the station for ten days--an eternity. I lived in a hut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into the accountant's office.

If you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he You know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me .

Five such installments came, with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the loot of outfit shops . 'I am as harmless as a little child, but I don't like to be dictated to. Am I the manager--or am I not? I was ordered to send him there. It's incredible,' said the other . They both agreed it was frightful, then made several 'No one, as far as I know, unless a species of wandering trader--a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory from the natives,' he said . The two below me moved away then a few paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance I saw the uncle extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the river . It was so startling that I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest . The high stillness confronted these two figures I had to keep guessing at the channel; I was learning to clap my teeth smartly . I felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at my monkey tricks . You do your tricks very well, but you never forget the thump--eh? A blow on the very heart. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet . The earth seemed unearthly, and the men were not inhuman, he says .

It was dreary reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures, and the copy ""I started the lame engine ahead. It must be this miserable trader--this intruder,' exclaimed the manager . I observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in this world . The essentials of this affair lay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power I was annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably too, since one night more could not matter much after so many months . At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a shutter lifts, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves . It culminated in a  'We will all be butchered in this fog,' murmured another . The whites, of course greatly discomposed, had a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row . Their faces were essentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned I saw the devils of hunger they didn't go for us--they were thirty to five--and have a good tuck in for once, amazes me now when I think of it . They were big powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with strength 'I would be desolated if anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up,' he said . ""I did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The thick fog was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it, Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had given me an irresistible impression of sorrow . The danger, if any, was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose . Even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violence--but more generally takes the form of a ""This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow,"" says the sounding-pole . At night I slept on the couch on the extreme fore-end of that roof, before the door . The helmsman was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen . 'Steer her straight,' I said to the helmsman . He held his head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little . A fusillade burst out under my feet a man in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, died without uttering a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle . The man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched that 'He is dead,' murmured the fellow, immensely impressed, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces . I flung one shoe overboard, and became aware that that was exactly what I had been looking forward to--a talk with Mr. Kurtz . He presented himself as I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz . Oh yes, I heard more than enough. And I was right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a voice . You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr. Kurtz The earth for you is a place to live in, where we must put up with sights, sounds, with smells too, by Jove! . The original Kurtz had been educated partly in England, and his sympathies were in the right place . All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz  I can't choose. He won't be forgotten. Whatever he was, it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career . He had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his honor . I missed my late helmsman awfully, even while his body was still lying in the pilot-house . I had to look after him, I worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created . And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt ""The manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events,"" he said . ""The station!' I edged in at once, still going half-speed,"" screamed the manager . He looked like a har I confess I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off that charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug nose up to me . The smiles vanished, and he shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment  'I am not so young as I look. I am twenty-five,' he said . ""I gave him one small lot of ivory a year ago, so that he could never call me a little thief when I get back. I hope he got it.

Dawn," Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Stormfur and Tawnypelt have returned to the Clans from a quest with a message: the Clans must move to a new home, or risk death. The destruction of the forest has already begun, with the Clans starving as the food supply has been cut off and their habitat destroyed by the humans building a new road. At the same time, cats are being taken away by humans, including a ThunderClan apprentice, Leafpaw. A patrol is sent to rescue the captured cats, but Graystripe is captured after he succeeds in rescuing Leafpaw and other cats from RiverClan and WindClan, as well as many non-Clan cats. It is difficult for Firestar, ThunderClan's leader, to convince ShadowClan and RiverClan to leave. Finally, RiverClan decides to leave when their river becomes poisoned by humans. ShadowClan also agrees to leave when a tree cut down by humans falls in their camp. While trying help ShadowClan, Firestar loses his fourth life when a tree falls on him. Midnight, an intelligent badger from the pervious book, had told the questing cats that a ""dying warrior"" will show the Clans the way to their new home. The dying warrior turns out to be the spirit of Mudfur, the RiverClan medicine cat who died earlier. As the Clans' spiritual ancestors are represented by the star, Mudfur ""runs"" though the night sky as a shooting star and drops behind the mountains, showing the new territory will be beyond the mountains. The Clans travel together through the mountains, guided by Brambleclaw, Squirrelpaw, Crowpaw, Tawnypelt, and Stormfur. While in the mountains, the Clans meet the Tribe of Rushing Water and Stormfur chooses to stay with the Tribe with Brook Where Small Fish Swim, whom he has fallen in love with, and his sister, Feathertail's, spirit. Near the end of the book, Squirrelpaw confesses her love to Brambleclaw and he confesses that he loves her back. At the end of the book, the Clans discover a forest around a lake that reflects all of the stars.

The Water of the Wondrous Isles," Stolen as a child and raised in the wood of Evilshaw as servant to a witch, Birdalone ultimately escapes in her captress's magical boat, in which she travels to a succession of strange and wonderful islands. During much of the first quarter of the novel, Birdalone is naked, a highly unusual detail in Victorian fiction. She is occasionally assisted out of jams by Habundia, her lookalike fairy godmother. She encounters three maidens who are held prisoner by another witch. They await deliverance by their lovers, the three paladins of the Castle of the Quest. Birdalone is clad by the maidens and seeks out their heroes, and the story goes into high gear as they set out to rescue the women. Ultimately, one lady is reunited with her knight, another finds a new love when her knight is killed, and the last is left to mourn as her champion throws her over for Birdalone.

The Seven Who Were Hanged," The Seven Who Were Hanged depicts the fates of five leftist revolutionaries foiled in their attack and two common peasants who have received death sentences. These condemned men are awaiting their executions by hanging. In prison, each of the prisoners deals with his fate in his own way.
","The Seven Who Were Hanged Author: Leonid Andreyev Release Date: June 1, 2009 [EBook #6722] Last Updated: September 15, 2019 Language: English Character set encoding: UTF-8 *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SEVEN WHO WERE HANGED *** Produced by Eric Eld the truth of life stands aghast in silence, and its brazen falsehood is loudly shouting, uttering pressing, painful questions: ""With whom shall I sympathize? Whom shall I trust? What constitutes his joy or his sorrow? We may guess only by his acts, which are oft-times enigmatic; by his laughter and by his tears I look with a lesser grief and suffering upon the execution of the revolutionists, such as Werner and Musya, than upon the strangling of ignorant murderers, miserable in mind and heart, like Yanson and Tsiganok . But how are the weak and the sinful to face it if not in madness, with the most violent shock to the very foundation of their a stranger in the house, with its paintings, its statues and its silence, the light—itself silent and indefinite—awakened painful thoughts in him as to the vanity of bolts and guards and walls . In the dead of night, in the silence and solitude of a strange bedroom, a sensation of unbearable fear swept over the dignitary . It seemed to him that Death would remain standing there, and would not go away until those people had been captured, until the bombs had been taken from them, until they had been placed in a strong prison . It sounded as if a hundred wound-up gramophones were placed in his room, and all of them were shouting with idiotic repetition the words they had It is not death that is terrible, but the knowledge of it: it would be utterly impossible to live if a man could know exactly and definitely know it . It isn't death that's terrible; it would not go away because it was my thought . In his night-clothes, the dignitary resembled any other angry old man who suffered with It was not given to any living being—man or beast—to know the day and hour of death . Here had he been ill not long ago and the physicians told him that he must expect the end . In his youth he had become entangled in an affair and had resolved to end his life . It would always be thus—at the very last moment something would change, Four terrorists, three men and a woman, armed with bombs, infernal machines and revolvers were seized at the entrance of the house, and another woman was later found and arrested in the house where the conspiracy had been hatched . At the trial all of them were calm, but very serious and thoughtful . Each was simply as calm as was necessary to hedge in his Sergey Golovin was the son of a retired colonel, himself an ex-officer . He was so strong that neither the prison nor the expectation of inevitable death could remove the color from his cheeks and the expression of youthful, happy frankness from his blue eyes . Now the strange and beautiful sky could be seen through an upper window which was dust-covered and unwash The judges pitied Sergey Golovin; her they despised; her neighbor, known only by the name of Werner, sat also motionless, in a somewhat affected pose, his hands folded between his knees . His features were refined and delicate, so that he reminded you of a moonlit night in the South near the seashore, where the cy Sergey Golovin's death was disclosed in him so clearly that the judges avoided looking at him . It was hard to define his age, as is the case with a corpse which has begun to decompose . The most terrible sensation was when Werner touched his knee with his hand . Ivan Yanson, a peasant, was a workman for a well-to-do farmer, in no way different from other workmen . In general, Yanson had practically remained silent for almost two years . He would beat it cruelly, with stolid, angry persistency, and when the horse was annoyed by his manner, he would Yanson would drive off about half a verst away, and there, stalling the sled and the horse in the snow on the side of the road . The horse would rear, as if possessed by a demon, and the sweat would stand under his little reddish nose . Soon he would return to the station, and would quickly become intoxicated  Ivan Yanson, who distrusted a gun, committed a complicated attempt at robbery, murder and rape . Yanson was caught an hour later, kneeling down behind the corner of the barn, striking one match after another, which would not ignite . In court he was the same as always; a little man, freckled, with sleepy, glass Yanson wore on his neck a knitted, muddy-red shawl, and in places had dampened the hair of his head . When the sentence was pronounced—death by hanging—Yanson suddenly became agitated . Yanson turned his eyes to the judge who had not read the sentence, and repeated: “Why must I be hanged?” Yan Yanson was not offended that it was not worth bothering for one man, especially for a man like you . He considered it as an excuse for postponing the execution, preparatory to revoking it altogether . And perhaps for the first time in his life he laughed, a hoarse, absurd, yet gay laughter . Yanson had long forgotten about his crime, only sometimes he regretted that he had not been successful in attacking his master’s wife . But from these monotonously repeated words, and from the fact that each day came, passed and ended as every ordinary day had passed, Yanson became convinced that there would be no execution . Yanson began to lose all memory of the trial, and somehow  In order not to believe in death, it was necessary to hear and see ordinary things about him, footsteps, voices, light, the soup of sour cabbage . But in the dark everything was unnatural; the silence and the darkness were in themselves something like death . And the longer the night dragged the more dreadful it became . Yanson lay on his back, with mouth open, and snored loudly, and between his lashes, which were not tightly closed, his flat, dead eyes were upturned so that the pupil did not show, could be seen . He did not think of anything, but simply stood in mute stupefaction before this contradiction which tore his brain in two . Yan Yanson, a man with shoulder-straps, tied his muddy-red muffler about his neck . His latest crime, proven beyond question, had been the murder of three people and armed robbery . He called himself murderer with utter frankness and sincerity, and scornfully regarded those who style themselves “expropriators Tsiganok was black-haired, lean, with yellow spots on his prominent, ""Tartar-like cheek-bones"" The soldier looked at him sternly, with fear, exchanged glances with his comrade, and felt the lock of his gun . The soldiers felt that they were flying through the air, as if hypnotized by the prison Mishka Tsiganok, like Yanson, had to spend seventeen days in prison before his execution . All seventeen days passed as though they were bound up in one inextinguishable thought of escape, of freedom, of life . With his nostrils expanded, it seemed to him that he could smell the odor of hemp, of the smoke of fire . Now  “Well, what do you say? I suppose they’re choked on the sly.” Tsiganok grinned . “You have lost your wits, my friend,” said the warden . The warden came in twice again, and TSiganok, showing his teeth, said: “How eager you are! Come in again!” The whirling current Tsiganok drew out each note carefully in a mournful wail full of untold sorrow and terror . Then suddenly he would mutter softly, staring at the ground: ""My darlings, my sweethearts!... My sweethers! have pity... My darls!"" And it seemed again as if he Sergey Golovin was tortured by the thought of the coming meeting . The execution itself seemed to reach beyond time, beyond life itself . Sergey’s father, a retired colonel, was the first to enter the room where the meeting took place . Seryozhenka kissed him on the lips and sat down silently . She did not rush over to him; she did not break into a sob . Sergey did not know that the colonel had deliberated upon this ritual . But somehow he became confused, forgetting what he had prepared . Sergey strode forward, and all quivering in every fold of his coat, in every wrinkle of his face, not understanding how terrible he himself looked in his death-like whiteness . Then he stepped back, placed his clenched fists before him and repeated: “Don’t torture him!” The colonel interrupted: “Well, we must Sergey Kashirin, who was a wealthy tradesman, didn’t want to come . Vasily met the old woman, as he was pacing up and down the room, trembling with cold, although it was warm, even hot . The old woman burst out weeping, wiping her face with the ends of her black, woolen  The old woman wept bitterly, wiping her face with the edges of her kerchief . She retraced her steps to the prison, and then she strangely lost her way in the city in which she had been born . The icy path was wet and slippery, and she could not rise . And suddenly she understood that they were pouring out more wine for A strange melody, foreign to earth, was slowly and mournfully born and died out up in the heights . Through the roof, through the thickness of the stone walls, it penetrated, stirring the silence . Sometimes they awaited it in despair, living from one sound to the next . Only important criminals were sent to this prison . Tanya Kovalchuk pictured to herself the meeting between Sergey and his parents . It had long seemed to her that Musya loved Werner, and she still dreamed of something good and bright for both of them . When she had been free, Tanechka had worn a silver ring, on which was the design of a skull, bones, and a ""Is it possible that I am worthy of it? That I deserve that people should weep for me, should be agitated over my fate, over such a little and insignificant girl?"" he said . ""And that is—Death? That is not Death!” he added . She wished to be able to prove to them that she was not at all Musya was thinking of many things, for to her the thread of life was not broken by Death, but kept winding along calmly and evenly . She thought of her comrades, of those who were far away, and who in pain and sorrow were living through the execution together with them . So suddenly she was seized with a desperate desire to see Seryozha Go Musya recalled three of her comrades who had been hanged but a short time before, and their faces seemed bright and happy and near to her . The bell of the clock rang unceasingly, disturbing the deep silence, and the smoothly gliding images turned into music . In astonishment, she opened her eyes, lifted her head—outside the window was black night, and the clock was striking . She could hear distinctly how the soldiers were coming from behind the corner of the fortress, on the right, and now they were passing her window . Now the band came up alongside of her window and the cell was filled with merry, rhythmic Sergey Golovin was a strong, healthy, cheerful youth, endowed with that calm, clear joy of living . He was an excellent sailor, an expert shot with the revolver, and a fanatic believer in the “word of honor.” His friends laughed at him, saying that if the most notorious spy told him upon his word of honor that he was not Sergey drank two glasses of tea with milk, and a whole five-copeck roll of bread . Then he looked at Werner’s untouched bread and said: “Why don’t you eat? Eat. We must brace up.” “You have a fine appetite, Seryozha.” Instead of answering, Sergey began to sing in a Sergey shook his head mournfully, heaving long, painful sighs . ""I am not afraid of this devil!” he thought of Death . He felt as though he had been stripped, stripped entirely, . Sergey Golovin tried to walk across the cell—and it seemed strange to him that he could sit . He choked, began to cough and while coughing, thought: “How strange it is that I am coughing” He remained breathless, motionless, petrified for hours, suppressing every thought, all loud breathing, all motion,—for every thought seemed to him Sergey Golovin swaddled Sergey as a doll and they hang him by the neck until he is dead . His expression changed as though he had two different faces . The former, the young face, had disappeared somewhere, and a new one, a terrible face that had seemed to have come out of the darkness, had taken its place . He was Vasily Kashirin was condemned to death by hanging, everything now seemed like children’s playthings . His cell, the door with the peephole, the strokes of the wound-up clock, the carefully molded fortress, and especially that mechanical puppet with the gun who stamped his feet in the corridor . And the fact that this machine-like work will be performed over him Vasily Kashirin tried to speak to his mother, while thinking at the same time with a shudder: “O Lord! That is a puppet. A mother doll.” And at the very first words it disappeared again, and it was interesting and terrible to see that water was flowing from the eyes of the doll. It had happened, during painful periods in his life, that he whispered Vaska Kashirin recalled wax candles burning; the priest in his vestments; the _ikon_ painted on the wall . All was empty within his soul and about him . It was as though some one’s calm and mournful image had flashed up in the distance and died out quietly . Werner was tired of life and struggle . He had mastered several European languages and could pass for a German, a Frenchman or an Englishman . The enemy against whom he struggled every day could not inspire him with respect . Werner knew that the execution was not merely death, that it was something different, but he resolved to face it calmly, as something not to be considered . Only in this way could he express his greatest contempt for capital punishment and preserve his last freedom of the spirit which could not be torn away from him . Even the sentence condemning him to death by hanging did not remove ""What is this? What a divine spectacle!"" Werner said slowly, rising involuntarily and straightening himself, as if in the presence of a supreme being . And destroying the walls, space and time with the impetuosity of his all-penetrating look, cast a wide glance somewhere into the depth of the life he was to fors Werner suddenly started to weep, crying bitterly . ""My dear comrades! My dear, dear . dear COMrades!"" he whispered, crying . “My dear people!” he wept and leaned his right hand on it . He had never assumed such a proud, free, commanding pose . Only Tanya Kovalchuk availed herself at once of the permission . The others firmly and silently shook each other’s hands . Now that they were together, they felt somewhat ashamed of what each of them had experienced when alone . After a short silence they glanced at each other, smiled and immediately began to feel at ease and unrestrained, as Suddenly Musya took Werner by the hand and said: “Yes, now I love very much. Don’t tell it to the others,—it isn’t necessary, I feel somewhat ashamed, but I love deeply.” Their eyes met and flashed up brightly, and everything about them seemed to have plunged in darkness . They understood each other and something was firmly settled Sergey Golovin heaved a deep sigh and held his breath, as though he regretted to exhale from his lungs the fine, fresh air . When Werner bent down, about to climb into the carriage, the gendarme whispered to him: “There is somebody else going along with you.” The man suddenly asked in broken Russian, Werner was dizzy from the continuous turning of the dark box and he felt slightly sick at his stomach . He was silent for awhile, then pressed the Esthonian’s hand more firmly . It seemed very possible that flags were waving over the houses . Yanson was silent, shrinking together . Sergey Golovin began to say something, but only the word “lantern” was heard distinctly . The lamp in the lantern was smoking very much, and the glass had already turned black . Mishka Tsiganok entered, stamping noisily with his heels, breathing loudly and spitting . He cast a swift glance and stopped obdurately . “You make it so that I am comfortable here, otherwise I won’t go—hang me here on the lamp-post!” He bent down his head, stretched out his neck and thus went forward Sergey Golovin stayed out late in the city with friends, and was now coming back on the last train . Then he turned to Yanson and asked gently: “And you, friend, are you cold?” Sergey asked suddenly . “We have something to smoke.” “I do.” “Give him a cigarette, Seryozha,” said Werner delighted Yanson held a cigarette, an ordinary cigarette in his ordinary live hands, and looked at it with surprise, even with terror . ""Let it go,"" said Tanya, frowning, looking uneasily at Yanson, whose hand was hanging loosely, as if dead . Suddenly Yanson’s wizened face became wofully wrinkled, Then they walked in a large, black, silent crowd amid the forest, along a rough, wet and soft spring road . From the snow, a fresh, strong breath of air was wafted, sometimes the hands of the comrades clung to each other . Consciousness of what they were doing returned to the prisoners, but not completely,  Yanson was lying on the snow, and about him people were busying themselves . The light of the dark lantern flashed upon the paper and on the white, gloveless hands holding it . Tanya Kovalchuk answered for them all, and the little lantern was soon extinguished . “You are a pure soul—you can go alone wherever you please!” said Tanya Kovalchuk . “I can’t go alone!” said Yanson drowsily . Then he took her part heatedly, holding her by the hand, as though fearing some one would take her away from him .

Paradise Lost," The poem is separated into twelve ""books"" or sections, and the lengths of each book varies greatly (the longest being Book IX, with 1,189 lines, and the shortest Book VII, having 640). The Arguments at the head of each book were added in subsequent imprints of the first edition. Originally published in ten books, in 1674 a fully ""Revised and Augmented"" edition with a new division into twelve books was issued. This is the edition that is generally used today. The poem follows the epic tradition of starting in medias res (Latin for in the midst of things), the background story being recounted later. Milton's story has two narrative arcs: one being that of Satan (Lucifer) and the other being that of Adam and Eve. It begins after Satan and the other rebel angels have been defeated and banished to Hell, or (as it is also called in the poem), Tartarus. In Pandæmonium, Satan employs his rhetorical skill to organise his followers; he is aided by Mammon and Beelzebub. Belial and Moloch are also present. At the end of the debate, Satan volunteers to poison the newly-created Earth and God's new and most favoured creation, Mankind. He braves the dangers of the Abyss alone in a manner reminiscent of Odysseus or Aeneas. After an arduous traverse of the Chaos outside Hell, he enters God's new material World, and later the Garden of Eden. At one point in the story, the Angelic War over Heaven is recounted. Satan's rebellion follows the epic convention of large-scale warfare. The battles between the faithful angels and Satan's forces take place over three days. The final battle involves the Son of God single-handedly defeating the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishing them from Heaven. Following the purging of Heaven, God creates the World, culminating in his creation of Adam and Eve. While God gave Adam and Eve total freedom and power to rule over all creation, He gave them one explicit command: not to eat from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death. The story of Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a fundamentally different, new kind of epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented for the first time in Christian literature as having a full relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised in the form of a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another so that if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong. After eating the fruit, Adam and Eve have lustful sex, and at first, Adam is convinced that Eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial. However, they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, and after they awake, they experience guilt and shame for the first time. Realizing that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual recrimination. Eve's pleas to Adam reconcile them somewhat. Her encouragement enables Adam and Eve both to approach God, to ""bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee"", and to receive grace from God. Adam is shown a vision by the angel Michael, in which Adam witnesses everything that will happen to mankind until the Great Flood. Adam is very upset by this vision of humankind's future, and so Michael also tells him about humankind's potential redemption from original sin through Jesus Christ (whom Michael calls ""King Messiah""). Adam and Eve are cast out of Eden, and Michael says that Adam may find ""a paradise within thee, happier far"". Adam and Eve also now have a more distant relationship with God, who is omnipresent but invisible (unlike the tangible Father in the Garden of Eden).
