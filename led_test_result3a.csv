Evolution," The book follows the evolution of mankind as it shapes surviving Purgatorius into tree dwellers, remoulds a group that drifts from Africa to a (then much closer) New World on a raft formed out of debris, and confronting others with a terrible dead end as ice clamps down on Antarctica. The stream of DNA runs on elsewhere, where ape-like creatures in North Africa are forced out of their diminishing forests to come across grasslands where their distant descendants will later run joyously. At one point, hominids become sapient, and go on to develop technology, including an evolving universal constructor machine that goes to Mars and multiplies, and in an act of global ecophagy consumes Mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the Solar system in search of new planets to assimilate. Human extinction (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book, as well as the end of planet Earth and the rebirth of life on another planet. (The extinction-level event that causes the human extinction is, indirectly, an eruption of the Rabaul caldera, coupled with various actions of humans themselves, some of which are only vaguely referred to, but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non-engineered humans.) Also to be found in Evolution are ponderous Romans, sapient dinosaurs, the last of the wild Neanderthals, a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs, symbiotic primate-tree relationships, mole people, and primates who live on a Mars-like Earth. In the book's epilogue, it is implied that the replicator machines sent by humans to Mars have developed sentience and high technology, unknowingly advancing the late mankind's legacy in the Universe.

Cause of Death," New Year's Eve and the final murder scene of Virginia's bloodiest year takes Scarpetta thirty feet below the Elizabeth River's icy surface. Dr. Scarpetta receives a phone call reporting the death of investigative reporter Ted Eddings, who was found dead in diving gear amongst the Navy's reserve fleet. Was Eddings probing the frigid depths of the inactive shipyard for a story, or simply diving for sunken trinkets&mdash;and why did Scarpetta receive the phone call reporting the death before the police were notified? The case leads Scarpetta, her niece Lucy, and police captain Pete Marino into a terrorist plot that threatens thousands of lives.
","Max Tadlock explains the cause of his death in this e-book, which he published in February of that year. He begins to prepare for his departure by recalling a passage from a science fiction book called ""CaUSE of Death"" . The text is full of factual information and does not contain any direct references to actual events or persons who have committed suicide. In fact, some of the details are taken directly from the book. For example, there is no physical evidence that anyone has committed suicide on July 15, 1855; rather, it is an accidental drowning caused by a faulty electrical current. At the end of the chapter, we learn that the narrator's name is Tadlock.",1.0834636483295417,0.11695905934133599

In Los Angeles, Angel is searching for a mystical object that is linked to his days as the evil Angelus. Spike arrives.

","In this chapter, the setting is set for the night of February 1868 at Batu Kawan. The ship has already left the port and is now on its way to Banten, where Captain Briggs awaits his arrival. As they are about to board the boat, a drunken sailor approaches them with a lantern in hand. He tries to throw some holy stones into the water but misses. A group of sailors begins to fight over who gets to rowboat first. They try to save the sailor from drowning, but he swears that he will not let anyone else do the job. Finally, the captain of the silver fleece asks if there is any hope of saving the sailor. There is, though, a rumor that Dengan Jauga may be dead or dying. This makes the captain even more determined to kill her. The battle begins. The sailors gather on the deck and prepare to attack the enemy ship, which has already run aground because of a skirmish between Briggs and his crew. As the battle commences, Bledsoe notices that two white men--Filhiol , and Dr. John Cruncher--have been killed in the skirmish. They are joined by Captain Briggs who tells them that there is a war party headed their way. He also says that they should shoot at it if it does not clear up before it reaches shore. Finally, he orders all the sailors to get out their weapons and set fire to the boats as soon as they reach shore. Shortly afterwards, Major Crevays arrives with a telescope; Briggs instructs him to use it to track down the boat and its occupants. After some time, the search party assembles again, this time using only food and water from the gunpowder drawers. Meanwhile, the whites begin firing at the English ships, hoping to destroy them or even kill them themselves. At last, the fight ends. The battle continues. Briggs and his men attempt to get the sailor to tell Briggs that they will kill her if she does not comply with their orders. Briggs laughs at the spectacle, but when the sailor refuses, Briggs pulls his gun and shoots him in the arm. The ship is docked near Columnock Point, where Briggs and Watson work on repairing a broken-down hull of the silver freighter, nicknamed the ""Silver Flleece."" At noon, Briggs sees an old man sitting by the side of the boat. Briggs asks him where he lives, and Briggs tells him it is called Snughaven. Briggs looks out across the bay toward the ocean and watches the sea as it seeps into the town. Then Briggs walks over to the Captain's buggy and waits for him there. He sits down and thinks about how much fun life has been for him since returning home. After all, what else could he possibly be doing here? . Filhiol tells Briggs that he has just had news from the captain: Captain Briggs has visited him. Briggs asks if he can bring his horse up to the Quarterdeck with him, so they shake hands and then head off to dinner. Afterward, Briggs is surprised to find out that Captain Hal has come home. Briggs explains that Hal will be coming home in a few days. When Hal sees Briggs, he begins to cry. Briggs points out that Hal looks exactly like his grandfather did when he was a young man. They talk for a while about Hal's good fortune until Captain Briggs gets tired of it and goes back to work. Meanwhile, Doctor Thorpe is getting ready to leave on his trip to meet Hal at the docks. As soon as Hal leaves, Dr. Thorpe runs into Captain Briggs who invites him over for some eggnog. Captain Briggs is furious with Hal for causing the Captain to lose his job. He tells Hal that he will take care of him if Hal refuses to help him in any way. Hal agrees, but when Briggs asks what Hal has been doing, Hal says that he has had a rough day. Briggs points out that Hal may have drunk some alcohol, but Hal insists that it is not alcohol. Briggs then informs Hal that they are on their way home and Hal must stay overnight aboard the ship until he can get his papers back from Australia. Hal returns home and Briggs explains that Hal was attacked by Captain Briggs while he was asleep. Briggs reminds Hal that Hal did not mean to hit him; instead, Hal simply looked at the Captain and said, ""Here you go! top o' the first morning to your grandfather. . . . before breakfast. When Hal leaves, Briggs tries to talk to Hal about how much better Hal looks than before. But Hal won't listen. Finally, Briggs gets up and goes to the Captain's cabin. The Captain makes an impassioned plea for Hal to be allowed to stay aboard the boat as long as he does not need to open the cabin door. Briggs tells Hal Briggs that he has just learned the truth about his confrontation with Hal: Hal Briggs is dead. He will cut out alcohol entirely and live as a free man. Hal thanks Briggs for reminding him of how to behave in college. Briggs gives up smoking, drinking, and generally being a good ol’ fashioned jerk. The narrator notes that Hal seems to have matured into a mature, well-to-do young man who can take charge of his own life. When Briggs gets home from work, he finds a letter addressed to him from Squirrells solicitors asking him to help find Laura. In it, they learn that Hal has been using some kind of poison called ""His Woman"" to try to seduce Laura. After listening to the story, we get a brief look back at Hal's relationship with Laura. It turns out that when Hal was younger, he used to be very protective of Laura; now, though she is older, he tries to protect her. The Old Captain returns home and sees Dr.Filhiol in the yard with his wife and their son. He tells them that Hal has been abusing Laura. They decide to take care of the situation, but first they have to find a place for Hal to stay while they figure out how to get him off the hook. The Old Captain asks if Hal will be willing to let him alone on this journey. When he says yes, the Old Captain promises to do whatever he can to keep Hal from getting into trouble. After dinner, Hal arrives at the family gravesite. His grandfather is sitting there waiting for Hal. Hal begins to talk about Malay culture and religion. Hal explains that all men are cursed by one thing: sin. Hal agrees to go along with the plan, even though it means risking his life trying to help someone else. Hal convinces the old Captain not to worry so much about any harm he might receive from being around people who commit adultery. Hal then proceeds to make an example of Mr. Briggs, telling him what a good man he is. Hal threatens to kill Hal if he does not tell him about the missing money. When Hal refuses, Hal throws Ezra back into his room and locks the door behind him. Meanwhile, Jim Gordon arrives with news that Hal has robbed Captain Briggs of some $25,000.00. Hal is furious at this news, but agrees to let Hal go because it will give Briggs a chance to redeem himself in the future. He also tells Hal that Hal can now return to school for the fall without having to worry about being arrested or anything. Finally, Hal gives up on trying to save Captain Briggs; he just wants to start over again. Hal declares that Hal has stolen his money and threatens the men with violence if they do not stop him. Briggs tries to calm Hal, but Hal is so enraged by Hal's declaration of guilt that he begins to threaten them all. Hal throws a rock at one of Hal's pursuers, who runs away in terror. Meanwhile, Captain Briggs finds a note from Chapter XXXIX titled One Must Die. The note says that Hal must die if he is to be salvaged from the wreckage of the Kittiwink. After Briggs leaves, Hal sinks into the deep end of the ocean during a raging storm. He picks up a bottle of whiskey, drinks, and burns it before continuing on toward shore. When he reaches shore, though, he feels sickened by the taste of the alcohol flowing down his throat. In an attempt to revive his senses, Hal stabs a sailor whose leg has been broken. This causes Hal to bleed profusely. As Hal swims towards shore, he realizes that there is no way out; he swears to take care of the sailor. advertisement",0.14344954000271762,0.080246912
Death in Venice," The main character is Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous author in his early fifties who has recently been ennobled in honor of his artistic achievement (and thus has acquired the aristocratic ""von"" to his name). He is a man dedicated to his art, disciplined and ascetic to the point of severity, who was widowed at a young age. As the story opens, while strolling outside a cemetery, he sees a coarse-looking red-haired foreigner who stares back at him belligerently. Aschenbach walks away, embarrassed but curiously stimulated. He has a vision of a primordial swamp-wilderness, fertile, exotic and full of lurking danger. Soon afterwards, he resolves to take a holiday. After a false start in traveling to Pula on the Yugoslav coast, Aschenbach realizes he ""was meant"" to go to Venice, and he takes a suite in the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the Lido island. While shipbound and en route to the island he sees an elderly man, in company with a group of high-spirited youths, who has tried hard to create the illusion of youth with a wig, false teeth, makeup, and foppish attire. Aschenbach turns away in disgust. Soon afterwards he has a disturbing encounter with an unlicensed gondolier—another red-haired, skull-faced foreigner—who repeats ""I can row you well"" when Aschenbach orders him to return to the wharf. Aschenbach checks into his hotel, where at dinner he sees an aristocratic Polish family at a nearby table. Among them is an adolescent boy of about fourteen years in a sailor suit; Aschenbach, startled, realizes that the boy is supremely beautiful, like a Greek sculpture. His older sisters, by contrast, are so severely dressed that they look like nuns. Soon afterward, after spying the boy and his family at a beach, Aschenbach overhears the lad's name, Tadzio, and conceives what he first experiences as an uplifting, artistic interest. Soon the hot, humid weather begins to affect Aschenbach's health, and he decides to leave early and move to a more salubrious location. On the morning of his planned departure, he sees Tadzio again, and a powerful feeling of regret sweeps over him. When he reaches the railway station and discovers his trunk has been misdirected, he pretends to be angry, but is really overjoyed; he decides to remain in Venice and wait for his lost luggage. He happily returns to the hotel, and thinks no more of leaving. Over the next days and weeks, Aschenbach's interest in the beautiful boy develops into an obsession. He watches him constantly, and secretly follows him around Venice. One evening, the boy directs a charming smile at him, looking, Aschenbach thinks, like Narcissus smiling at his own reflection. Disconcerted, Aschenbach rushes outside, and in the empty garden whispers aloud, ""I love you!"" Aschenbach next takes a trip into the city of Venice, where he sees a few discreetly worded notices from the Health Department warning of an unspecified contagion and advising people to avoid eating shellfish. He smells an unfamiliar strong odour everywhere, and later realises it is disinfectant. However, the authorities adamantly deny that the contagion is serious and the tourists continue to wander round the city, oblivious. Aschenbach at first ignores the danger because it somehow pleases him to think that the city's disease is akin to his own hidden, corrupting passion for the boy. During this period, a third red-haired, disreputable-looking man crosses Aschenbach's path; this one belongs to a troupe of street singers who entertain at the hotel one night. Aschenbach listens entranced to songs that, in his former life, he would have despised &ndash; all the while stealing glances at Tadzio, who is leaning on a nearby parapet in a classically beautiful pose. The boy eventually returns Aschenbach's glances and though the moment is brief it instills in the writer a sense that the attraction may be mutual. Next, Aschenbach rallies his self-respect and decides to discover the reason for the health notices posted in the city. After being repeatedly assured that the sirocco is the only health risk, he finds a British travel agent who reluctantly admits that there is a serious cholera epidemic in Venice. Aschenbach considers warning Tadzio's mother of the danger; however, he decides not to, knowing that if he does, Tadzio will leave the hotel and be lost to him. One night, a dream filled with orgiastic Dionysian imagery reveals to him the sexual nature of his feelings for Tadzio. Afterwards, he begins staring at the boy so openly and following him so persistently that Aschenbach feels the boy's guardians finally notice, and take to warning Tadzio whenever he approaches too near the strange, solitary man. But Aschenbach's feelings, though passionately intense, remain unvoiced; he never touches Tadzio, or even speaks to him; and while there is some indication that Tadzio is aware of his admiration, the two exchange nothing more than the occasional surreptitious glance. Aschenbach begins to fret about his aging face and body. In an attempt to look more attractive, he visits the hotel's barber shop almost daily, where the barber eventually persuades him to have his hair dyed and his face painted to look more youthful. The result is a fairly close approximation to the old man on the ship who had so appalled Aschenbach. Freshly dyed and rouged, he again shadows Tadzio through Venice in the oppressive heat. He loses sight of the boy in the heart of the city; then, exhausted and thirsty, he buys and eats some over-ripe strawberries and rests in an abandoned square, contemplating the Platonic ideal of beauty amidst the ruins of his own once-formidable dignity. A few days later, Aschenbach goes to the lobby in his hotel, feeling ill and weak, and discovers that the Polish family plan to leave after lunch. He goes down to the beach to his usual deck chair. Tadzio is there, unsupervised for once, and accompanied by an older boy, Jasiu. A fight breaks out between the two boys, and Tadzio is quickly bested; afterward, he angrily leaves his companion and wades over to Aschenbach's part of the beach, where he stands for a moment looking out to sea; then turns halfway around to look at his admirer. To Aschenbach, it is as if the boy is beckoning to him: he tries to rise and follow, only to collapse sideways into his chair. His body is discovered a few minutes later.
","Aschenbach leaves his apartment in Munich to go for a walk. While walking, he meets a man dressed in Bavarian clothes. The man's face is contorted and unnaturally long; his hair is pulled back into a ponytail, which suggests that he has some sort of mental disorder. He looks at the man closely and notices that his eyes are set on something other than his true identity. This realization freaks him out more than anything else. When the man asks where he is going, however, aschenbach says that he will be arriving in South America only a week or so later. In Venice, Ascherbach boards a steamboat bound for San Marco Island. There, he encounters an old gypsy-man whom he calls ""the one poet."" After dinner, they board a ship bound for Venice. Aschenbach returns to Venice, where he finds the family of a Polish girl and her Polish governess sitting at a dining room table. He notices that they do not seem to greet each other as usual in the Polish household. After breakfast, Ascherbach heads over to the girls' place for a private swim. They are about to finish their breakfast when an older boy passes them by. The young man is named Adgio, which means ""half-grown."" When the old man asks him why he has stayed so long, Anashebach tells him it is because he wants to get out of Venice. At first, though, he does not know what to make of this news. But then he begins to realize how much love and affection there is between these two people. In fact, one day, after taking a walk on the seashore, he meets Tadzius, his childhood friend from Tazewell who has just returned from the Steerforth Islands. It turns out that both parents have gone back to Italy with their sick children. advertisement",0.3952871078280641,0.1955085825642834
The Message," Cassie and Tobias are having strange dreams about a presence in the ocean. Jake sees a news item on television about debris with what looks like Andalite lettering on it that has washed up on the beach, and when he shows it to the others, Cassie and Tobias have such strong visions that they momentarily pass out. The Animorphs decide to investigate, and acquire dolphin morphs to do so. While out in the ocean, they find a humpback whale under attack by a group of sharks. The Animorphs fight the sharks and drive them off, and Marco is nearly killed in the process. Marco is able to morph back to his human form, and the whale, grateful, saves him from drowning. The whale speaks to Cassie through song, telling her about a strange place of grass and trees under the ocean. Cassie has a feeling that this place is of Andalite origin, and the Animorphs wonder if Cassie's and Tobias's visions are a sort of distress call from an Andalite trapped in the ocean. They decide that the distress call is connected to the morphing ability, and Cassie and Tobias feel it the strongest because Cassie is the most in control of her morphing ability and Tobias is trapped in a morph. They also figure out that Visser Three could be receiving the message and that the Yeerks are probably looking for the lost Andalite as well. The Andalite's location is too far from the shore for the Animorphs to reach under the two hour morphing limit, so they (except Tobias) morph into seagulls and stow away on a large container ship (called the Newmar, from Monrovia, headed towards Singapore) that is heading in the right direction. They abandon ship and morph to dolphin when they are in range and discover the Dome of an Andalite Dome ship deep beneath the ocean's surface. They enter through an airlock and meet Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill. Marco quickly gives him the nickname Ax, and the Animorphs tell him that he is the only survivor of the Andalite-Yeerk battle in Earth orbit and that they met and received the morphing power from Prince Elfangor. Ax reveals that Elfangor was, in fact, his older brother. The meeting is brief however, as the Yeerks discover the sunken Dome ship and begin to drop depth charges. Ax had previously acquired a tiger shark, and he and the Animorphs escape. They are pursued by Visser Three in Mardrut morph; as they tire, Visser Three gains on them. The Animorphs decide to make a last stand, but are saved when Visser Three is attacked and chased off by a pod of humpback whales. The whales give the tired Animorphs a ride back to the shore. Ax pledges to fight with the Animorphs and adopts Jake as his prince. He acquires Jake, Rachel, Cassie, and Marco and mixes the DNA from each to create his own human morph. The Animorphs decide to hide him in the woods near Cassie's farm. *Ax is introduced.

Barchester Towers," Barchester Towers concerns the leading clergy of the imaginary cathedral city of Barchester. The much loved bishop having died, all expectations are that his son, Archdeacon Grantly, will succeed him. Instead, owing to the passage of the power of patronage to a new Prime Minister, a newcomer, the far more Evangelical Bishop Proudie, gains the see. His wife, Mrs Proudie, exercises an undue influence over the new bishop, making herself as well as the bishop unpopular with most of the clergy of the diocese. Her interference to veto the reappointment of the universally popular Mr Septimus Harding (protagonist of Trollope's earlier novel, The Warden) as warden of Hiram's Hospital is not well received, even though she gives the position to a needy clergyman, Mr Quiverful, with 14 children to support. Even less popular than Mrs Proudie is the bishop's newly appointed chaplain, the hypocritical and sycophantic Mr Obadiah Slope, who decides it would be expedient to marry Harding's wealthy widowed daughter, Eleanor Bold, and hopes to win her favour by interfering in the controversy over the wardenship. The Bishop, or rather Mr Slope under the orders of Mrs Proudie, also orders the return of the prebendary Dr Vesey Stanhope from Italy. Dr Stanhope has been there, recovering from a sore throat, for 12 years and has spent his time catching butterflies. With him to the Cathedral Close come his wife and his three adult children. The younger of Dr Stanhope's two daughters causes consternation in the Palace and threatens the plans of Mr Slope: Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni is a crippled serial flirt with a young daughter and a mysterious Italian husband whom she has left. Mrs Proudie is appalled by her and considers her an unsafe influence on her daughters, her servants and Mr Slope. Mr Slope is drawn like a moth to a flame and cannot keep away. Dr Stanhope's son Bertie is skilled at spending money but not at making it: his two sisters think marriage to rich Eleanor Bold will provide financial security for him. Summoned by Archdeacon Grantly to assist in the war against the Proudies and Mr Slope is the brilliant Reverend Francis Arabin. Mr Arabin is a considerable scholar, Fellow of Lazarus College at Oxford, who nearly followed his mentor John Henry Newman into the Roman Catholic Church. A massive misunderstanding occurs between Eleanor and her father, brother-in-law, sister and Mr Arabin: they all believe she intends to marry the oily chaplain Mr Slope. Mr Arabin is attracted to Eleanor but the efforts of Grantly and his wife to stop her marrying Slope also interfere with any relationship that might develop. At the Ullathorne garden party of the Thornes, matters come to a head. Mr Slope proposes to Mrs Bold and is slapped for his presumption; Bertie goes through the motions of a proposal to Eleanor and is refused with good grace, and the Signora has a chat with Mr Arabin. Mr Slope's double-dealings are now revealed and he is dismissed by Mrs Proudie and the Signora. The Signora drops a delicate word in several ears and with the removal of their misunderstanding Mr Arabin and Eleanor become engaged. The old Dean of the Cathedral having died, Mr Slope campaigns to become Dean, but Mr Harding is offered the preferment, with a beautiful house in the Close and of garden. However Mr Harding considers himself unsuitable and, with the help of the archdeacon, arranges that Mr Arabin be made Dean. With the Stanhopes' return to Italy, life in the Cathedral Close returns to its previous quiet and settled ways and Mr Harding continues his life of gentleness and music.
","This first chapter introduces the concept of a small print. The text was originally created as a single manuscript, but it has since been expanded to include multiple editions. In order to comply with U.S. copyright laws, the project needs donations from people who donate their time and money. This information is also included in the header of this Etext. It states that they will only give away one-tenth of the total etext given away by the year 2000. They are trying to raise enough money to hire more people so they can run the hospital. Dr. Grantly becomes the new archbishop of Barchess, succeeding his predecessor, Sir John Bold. He dies just eight months before he is consecrated bishop. His name is engraved on the telegraphed paper, ""The Electric Telegraph"" , which lists all the possible candidates for the bishop position. Just 8 months after his consecration, a second baby is born--this time an illegitimate child. The Bishop's Chapla In Chapter IV, the narrator focuses on the background of Dr. Slope and his family. He explains that he has been raised by a clergywoman named Mrs. Proudie who is very strict in her sermons and does not allow him to attend church meetings. She also opposes all forms of religion, such as secularism or religious observances. The narrator also discusses the relationship between Dr. Smollett and Mr. Harding, both of whom are considered ""bigoted"" by their superiors. However, they do not seem to have much in common with each other. They become bosom buddies when they learn that Barchester will soon be electing a new bishop; this news troubles them greatly. Meanwhile, Dr. Grantly is preparing Barchester for its new bishop--he wants to make sure Barchester can keep up with the growing number of Jesuits there. Mr. Slope delivers a sermon on the importance of studying to be approved by God in order to ""show self-denominably"" -- i.e. to abide by the doctrine of St. Paul, which condemns all forms of religion and encourages people to believe what they see and hear. However, Mr. Harding argues that this practice is not suitable for Barchester because it places too much strain on the already strained relationship between the church and the poor. The narrator notes that Dr. Grantly disapproves of Mr. Slopes preaching but does not condemn him personally. In fact, he criticizes the cathedral's teaching methods and practices. He even suggests that the cathedral should ban chanting from its cathedral service. Meanwhile, Eleanor has been introduced as the spiritual director of her family's Barchester home. She explains how she was forced to leave her position as warden at an Italian hospital after having fallen while ascending a ruined ruin during a trip to Italy. She says that she will never stand or move herself again. Madeline Neroni makes a visit to Barchester in order to meet her father, who is still recovering from his war wounds. She also creates a visiting card for herself and her sister-in-law . The card includes the names of all the baron's wives, their children, and their husbands. In addition, she imprints three lines on each name that say ""La Signor Madeline"" , ""Neroni,"" ""Her Name,"" and ""La Dame Neroni."" At first, the card does not seem to satisfy Mr. Slope; he seems to be more interested in making himself presentable than in actually being present. Meanwhile, at the same time, there are other visitors: Ethelberts wife, Madame Neroni--a woman named Netta Grantley--and her three young daughters. Finally, it is time for the bishop/chamberlain's party to roll into Barchester as planned. Mr. Harding tells Mr. Slope that he cannot take over the position of hospital chaplain because another man will fill it. Mrs. Proudie sees this as an opportunity to humiliate her husband, so she leaves him alone with his daughter Madeline Neroni while everyone else goes to bed. Later in the evening, Mr. SLope calls on Mr. Harding and asks him to visit him at St. Ewart's Hospital. He says that he wants to see Dr. Laurence Steerforth before he decides to make a decision about whether or not he should accept their offer. Mr. Skope responds by saying that he must go back to Barchester immediately if he is going to do any work there. This makes Mr. Harland very sad indeed. The narrator then gives us a brief account of some of the events leading up to this point. In Chapter I, we are introduced to the new Archbishop of York, Reverend Francis Albertson, who has just been appointed to serve as the new vicar for St.Ewart's. Mr. Harding does not like Mr. Slope at all, and points out that it is his duty as a bishop to make sure that the people who support him stay in his good graces. He says that he will see how things work out with Mrs. Bold and Mr. Harding. The narrator then goes on to give an account of some of the schemes that have been foiled so far by Sir Walter Blunt. In Chapter VII, Eleanor tells her sister Madeline that she is going to get married. She also tells her father that she would rather die than go into the hospital or become a nursemaid herself. This upsets both her sister and her father very much. Finally, they tell her that there are no plans for her to leave Barchester until after the governor departs. The bishop is worried about whether or not Mr. Slope will succeed in overthrowing Mrs. Proudie and her husband. He sends for Mr. Harding, who has refused to take the hospital job. Meanwhile, Dr. Grantly tries to get Mr. Skope to give up his position as chaplain at Hirams hospital. Unfortunately, he can't do so because of Mrs. Steerforth's infidelity. The next morning, we learn that Mr. Thorpe has been forced to resign from his post due to financial difficulties. We also learn that Eleanor now has a crush on Mr. Barlow, whom she calls ""the jackal"" . In any case, it turns out that Dorothee really does have an ulterior motive: she wants to buy Sir Walter Scott's daughter, Mademoiselle Laurence-Stanhope , so she can marry him. It doesn't quite make sense to us, but we try to figure out how this could all work out. Eleanor and Bertie go to see Dr. Stanhurst, where they find Mr. Arabin reading from a signora. The narrator tells us that this is the first time we've heard of him; he's forty years old, unmarried, and doesn't have a great deal of money. He has no family, no friends, no prospects, nothing but ""the best interests"" of his church. At the same time, he has no wife , kids, or much in common with any parishioner. In fact, he spends most of his life surrounded by pious people who think highly of what they're doing and how they can't do anything about it. It's all part of Christian charity. But when you ask me why I didn't just get a job as a lowly clergyman some years ago, I'll tell you: because I wanted to be an active clergyman. Anyway, back to our narrator. We learn more about St. Ewart's parodic vicar-centre, Reverend Alan Arabin . He's got a rather odd way of looking at things--he uses round tables instead of round ones, which are supposed to be more conducive to social interaction. And then there's Mr. Alden, who tries to convince Eleanor that she shouldn't use round The next Sunday, Arabin and Hindley go to church. They discuss the parish squire, who they believe is currently the most important man in England. Mr. Thorne has been a very active member of the hunting club since his days as a youth. He does not want to over-indulge any members of the community by refusing to cut off their covers or allow them to draw freely on the earths during the course of a given day. However, he still supports free trade and defends the rights of all people under the Articles of Confederation. The chapter ends with the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Thorpe, the two young women who are to be married shortly. Their wedding is scheduled for later that afternoon. Mr. Slope visits Mr. and Mrs. Proudie to settle the matter with them regarding the new hospital warden, Mr. Harding. He makes it clear that he does not approve of any of the changes made by the bishop; furthermore, he has no interest in continuing as chaplain at Barchester unless they can find someone else to fill the position. Mrs. Quiverfull is furious because she believes that her husband should be allowed to stay on as wardens if he wants to continue working for a bishop. She also accuses him of breaking an agreement with Mrs. Puddingridge's parishioner, Dr. Margaret Proudie . The two women fight over who gets to take care of the sickest among the fourteen children - Mrs. Squiverful or Miss Proudie ? They finally come to an agreement about the wardship. It turns out that Mr. Slop wanted to go directly to Mrs. Burdette so he could have access to her while she was there. This freaks both of them out. Mr. Slope tries to persuade the bishop not to remove Mrs. Proudie from her position, but it is clear that he has no interest in this arrangement. He writes a letter to Mr. Harding asking him to offer his services as chaplain at the hospital. Mr. Slopes attempts to appeal to Eleanor and she responds by telling him that she does not wish to marry either of them. She also accuses him of being a hypocritical clergyman who only wants to please himself while enriching himself. The narrator concludes with a foreshadowing of what will happen next. Mr. Slope sends Eleanor a letter informing her that she is to be kept away from the Barchester house by Mr. and Mrs. Alden Steerforth. She also receives a letter telling her that there is a cholera epidemic in his neighborhood. When Eleanor tells her family about this news, they are all shocked and angry. Dr. Grantly tries to console her, but it is clear that she does not want to hear any more of what has happened. The next morning, Eleanor goes to visit her father at St. Ewart's. He says that he will miss her terribly if she continues with her relationship with Slope or refuses to see her as Mrs. Bennet. This makes him even more upset. Later, when Eleanor returns home, she finds out that she has received a love letter from someone named Obadiah SLOPE. It turns out that Doctor Grantly disapproves of Eleanor for having made such an acquaintance with such a vulgar man. In the aftermath of this revelation, Arabin comes to tell Eleanor that she can no longer receive letters from Slope unless she chooses to marry him. Mr. Arabin tells Eleanor that he does not approve of her marrying Slope because she is not married to him. She denies it, saying that she only wants to be with Mr. Slope so that she can marry him. Mrs. Bold becomes very angry when she hears this. She blames herself for the situation and says that she has no alternative but to accept Mr. Crabbe's proposal. The Archbishopdeacon arrives at the hospital just as Dr. Tulliverful is having an epileptic fit. He informs everyone that he plans to visit the Archbishop next week to find out whether or not he will be able to get his wish granted. Meanwhile, Sir Andrew Slope has been appointed to fill the vacant dean's position at St. Ewart's Hospital. This news causes much anxiety among the Barchester clergymen, who feel that they have lost hope of a new appointment. They are also concerned about the possible consequences of their decision. Mr. Slope searches for a new chaplain position, but finds no one willing or able to help him. In order to improve his chances of succeeding in the job, he writes to Charlotte and tells her that he is running out of money. Charlotte tries to persuade Eleanor not to go because she thinks it will be scandalous if she does. Meanwhile, Mr. Arabin has been invited to join the party as an aide to Dr. Stanhicks widow, Mrs. Bold. The party goes to Ullyathorne where they are to have dinner with the Archbishop and Lady Barlow. They all agree that Mr. Slop should be made dean of barchester. Everyone agrees that this seems like a good idea, except for Mr. Alden, who wants to make himself useful by sharing his wealth with Eleanor. He doesn't want anyone to think that he's going to marry her. Mrs. Greenacre decides to throw a party for the newlyweds, and even though she knows that her husband won't let her in on the party, she does manage to convince him to allow it. The party starts out well, with lots of food and drink, but then everyone is late because Mr. Slope has a headache from all the partying he's been doing lately. Then there's the De Courcies, who show up at the party as if they're guests. They also show off some of their wares, which are way too high-end for most people. But hey, you can always count on one thing: your dollar will buy you a new pair of shoes. And guess what? Your dollar won't buy you anything anymore. It'll just make you more eligible to get married. The narrator tells us that at the banquet of the Barchester deanship, Eleanor was caught up in a conversation with Mr. Slope about Miss Neroni and how she had ruined his reputation by speaking ill of him and making him look bad. At this point, the narrator also gives us some background on the rivalry between Mrs. Greenacre and her husband, Mr. Arabin . In Chapter XXXIX, we find out that Mr. Alanist is now the baritone vicar for Barchester; he has just been elected to the dean's position there. The narrator also shows us that as time goes on, things do not always go according to plan. There are two drawbacks to all of this: 1) Bertie gets kicked out of school; 2) Mrs. Bold becomes pregnant; 3) Mr. Laurence refuses to allow Bertie to have any part of his affairs. And finally, it seems like everyone else is getting hitched. It turns out that even though Mr. Peggotty doesn't approve of Mr. Lapointe's marriage plans, he still wants to be married to Eleanor. Mr. Slope offers Eleanor his hand in marriage. She rejects him, saying that she loves him with all her heart and would like to be with him forever. He tells her that he has come to see her because he wants to go to the top of the world. She protests, but refuses to accept him. Mr. Steerforth tries to comfort her by telling her how sweet it will be when she walks with him to the Top of the World's Largest Tree. The scene ends with Eleanor running away from Mr. Sikes carriage. Charlotte is on her way to tell Bertie about what happened at the Barchester party. It turns out that Mr. Slopes was drinking heavily during the party so he ended up hooking up with Mrs. Bold instead of marrying her. Charlotte then goes off to find Bertie for a few days. Meanwhile, Charlotte runs into Bertie while he is talking to Charlotte. They run into him as they are walking along the High St. towards their house. When Charlotte sees them, she realizes that they must leave immediately since there is no way around this situation. Mrs. Bold informs Eleanor that Charlotte wants to marry Mr.Stanhope because of the way he treated her when she was a child. Mrs. Bold is shocked at this news and does not understand how such a thing could have happened. She tells Bertie that his sister has been very kind to him in order to make him want to marry Charlotte. They talk for a long time, and finally decide that they need to move forward with the hospital settlement. The narrator gives us a brief account of the events leading up to their departure from the Vicarage. It turns out that Mary Bold received an invitation to visit the vicars' house so that she could discuss the matter with them. Unfortunately, Mary's aunt dies before she can attend the wedding. This means that Mary will not be attending the wedding; instead, she will go straight to work as a governess or chaplain. Charlotte tells her father that she will not begrudge him anything if he leaves his house. He agrees, and they go to visit the Signora , who is there to talk with Mr. Slope about what he plans to do with his life now that he has married Mrs. Bold. The Signora tells Charlotte that Mr. Thorpe intends to move to Carara, where he will have a better chance of making it as a dean . She also says that she wants to make an example of Mr. Arabin in order to get him to change his mind about going back to England. At the end of chapter two, we see how things are going for Barchester: everyone is getting ready to head back to London; Mr. Silvius Bennet is on his way to take care of his business; Dr. Stanhopes is looking for someone else to replace him. Meanwhile, Mr. Murdock is still hanging around Barchester trying to find some other way to keep himself from being kicked out of his old stomping ground. Mr. Harding tells Mrs. Grantly that he is delighted to have succeeded Mr. Slope as dean of the university. He says that he does not find himself fit for a new position, but will rather help people who are in need of a change of direction. The narrator notes that this chapter also deals with the ""magnificent injustice"" that Eleanor has been forced to endure. At the same time, there is much speculation about whether or not Mr. Arabin will be appointed dean of Ullathsorne. When he arrives at Uttathorne , he finds Eleanor sitting in her drawing room with her baby. She asks him to take the baby and love it; he takes her hand and puts his lips on hers. They speak for a few moments before she realizes that they are engaged. Afterward, she goes back to her room to tell her papa that she is engaged to Arabin . It turns out that Dr. Barlow was unaware of the engagement until later when Eleanor learns that Mrs. Bold has returned home. advertisement",0.6205629964540647,0.20721411751439656
Pollyanna Grows Up," Pollyanna, now cured of her crippling spinal injury, spends her time teaching the ""glad game"" to new town, and a very bitter woman, Mrs. Carew. Along the way she makes new friends, such as Sadie and Jamie: Jamie is a delicate literary genius whose withered legs compel him to rely on a wheelchair and crutches. Six years later, Pollyanna and her aunt fall upon hard times. Following the death of Dr. Chilton, as a means of making money, Pollyanna and her aunt are forced to take in the friends Pollyanna made six years earlier as boarders. However, there are many skeletons lurking in people's closets, causing numerous misunderstandings and many revelations, including how old childhood friend Jimmy 'Bean' Pendleton ended up alone.
","The narrator tells us that the novel opens with a prologue, in which we briefly meet Della wetherby and her younger sister, Ruth. The two sisters are discussing Pollyanna , who has come to live with Aunt Polly Carew after spending eight years as a missionary nurse at the sanatorium. She explains that she is very unhappy because she does not have anything else to do besides wait for someone to come by and give her a helping hand. When Della gets home, she finds out that Dr.' Ames has sent Della on a trip to Boston so that he can take care of his niece, whom he has named Pollyanna . Mrs. Cawthorne says that this trip will kill her if she doesn't let Pollyanna live with them while their Aunt Polly goes abroad. Meanwhile, Tom Chilton receives a letter asking him to send Pollyanna to stay with him while his aunt takes care of some family business. The game and the Carw Pollyanna visits Boston on her first visit. She finds that she likes it there, but doesn't like to be reminded of what life is like. She goes to a private school where she works as a governess. The narrator tells us that this is the second time Pollyanna has been to Boston; before, she used to go there every once in a while. But after two weeks, she has decided to leave those days behind and start over again. In Boston, she meets a ""lonesome"" young man who asks her for directions to his house. He explains that he lives in Boston with his Aunt Polly and their four children. They are all very nice people, though they don't always seem to notice or pay attention to each other when they're around others. This makes Pollyanna happy because she knows that she's going to meet someone new soon. One October day Pollyanna finds herself in Boston's public garden, where she meets a boy named ""Sir James"" who has been living with her since childhood. Sir James is the son of Captain Donnithorne and his wife, Mary. The Boy Feeds the Birds and Squirrels During this time Sir James also feeds animals and provides snacks for the children. He tells Pollyanna about how he was once very poor but that now he can help her by taking her to an orphanage called the 'Jolly Book'. This chapter ends on a note of happiness for Pollyanna when she discovers that she has found the missing Jamie--Jamie Kent. The narrator gives us a little history of the Chilton household, starting with Della Carew who visits Pollyanna regularly. She tells Pollyanna all that she knows about her sister and her brother-in-law's son, named ""the Professor,"" who lives in squalid conditions on the second floor of their tenement apartment. The professor is described as queer, has very few books, and seems to own only a few trinkets. This makes Pollyanna think that he might be someone else living in Squaw Valley--but it also forces her to question whether or not she really cares about him. Meanwhile, Phoebe asks Jerry Falstaff if he can come over for Christmas Eve because she wants to have a Christmas tree party. Falstaff says no, but then again, maybe they should just invite some more people over so they can see what's going on around them. In fact, Falstaff admits that he still doesn't want to go, but he'll make up for it when he grows up. The narrator notes that the Chilton family is excited about their upcoming trip to Germany. Jim tells his wife that he plans to take Pollyanna with him as they go. He explains that he has decided not to leave Little Em'ly, but rather to stay and help her while she recovers from her illness. They will be able to return home in a few months time. When they arrive, they find out that there is no money on the table. The Chilton children have been living at Aunt Polly's house for six months without paying any bills. Mr. Dickenson says that this is because of ""the game"" , which Pollyanna played before she was a child. She also says that she does not want to grow old by pretending to be poor. Mrs., Chilton asks if Pollyanna still plays the game . Pollyanna replies that she only wants to make money so she can buy them a place to live. Then she goes into an even more somber speech about how she wishes she could become rich someday. Aunt Polly sends out a prompt reply from Della, asking her to arrange for the arrival of some paying guests. When she arrives, she finds that everyone is excited about having a new addition to their family. She also meets her nephew, James, who is so happy he almost forgets his lame leg. The Paying Guests arrive on the appointed afternoon and they immediately begin preparations for their arrival. They are greeted warmly by all, including Jim, who has just returned from Boston. He tells them that he will be staying with them for at least a week before returning to New York City. On the way home, he tells Pollyanna that he wants to go on an extended camping trip because he thinks it is such a wonderful idea. But when he says that he does not want to go because he doesn't have the money or the desire to stay in New York , Pollyanna realizes that he means to say ""I would much rather have my share of the luxuries as a present"" . This makes him even more determined to go. In September, Jim tells Sadie that he has decided to give up hope of winning the three-million dollar prize. He also tells her that he is in love with a girl named Pollyanna whom he does not care about anymore. This makes Jim even more determined to give it a go. In early October, they leave Boston for New York City. Meanwhile, on the farm, Jimmy and his Aunt Polly are preparing for their return home. On one such day, they receive a letter informing them that Mrs. Farew has died. They are devastated but decide to stay in Boston until they can figure out a way to make some money. The following month, they move to be closer to Phoebe's family. During this time, they do not have much money, so they must rely on donations from other sources. One day, when Mary comes into the kitchen, she finds a letter waiting for them. It is addressed to Mr. Dickens, asking him if he would like to write another story. When he says yes, Miss Betsey suggests that he write one that will win the 3-000 dollar prize as well. The next day, Jimmy shows up at the station. He tells Pollyanna all about his meeting with John and how he found out that ""Jamie"" was in on the secret of winning the $3,000 prize for running a charity race with an handicapped man. When he learned that ""John Pendleton"" was also involved, he wanted to make sure that she cared for him. In fact, he wants her to marry him so that she will be able to support him financially when he marries someone else. The narrator gives us a brief account of some of the events leading up to this point: Jim is back from Boston; he has returned to New York City; he plans to stay there for a week; he hopes to find work soon enough to help him regain his old sense of direction. But first, he needs to tell Mrs. Cheswold--her daughter--the truth about who he really is. She refuses to hear any more details until after he has told her. Finally, they decide to let him know what's going on. advertisement",0.25182829725634936,0.12357723316015605
The Prince," Jonathan. His zeal carried him into battle. His faithfulness won him honor among his people. His humility led him into friendship with the man who would become king in his place. David was a man after God's own heart. But it was the courage and selflessness of his best friend that opened the door to David's rule. A man of honor and deep faith. Jonathan.
","The Prince is a historical account of the reign of Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici from 1513 until his death on June 22, 1527 at the age of eighty-five. The Prince was written in 1416 and 1617; it contains many references to classical antiquity, especially those relating to the period between 1494 and 1520. It also includes several references to the ""Prince"" , i.e. the man or the woman who controls the kingdom. In addition, the Prince has an important role in the formation of the Free Republic of Venice during the reigns of King Louis XIV and Henry VIII. Chapters VII and VIII discuss the different types of princes: those who rise from private citizens to become princes; those that fall under the influence of a powerful man or, more specifically, an aristocrat. Chapter VII discusses the three principalities of princes in terms of ability and fortune. In order to advance his goals, he first needs to establish a system of statehood for himself and his subjects before he can use it to impose his will on others. This is accomplished by overthrowing the tyrannical rule of the Roman Catholic Church. Chapters XI and XII discuss the roles of rulers and their advisors. The most important issue is the role played by monarchs during the reign of Alexander V, i.e., kings of Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and England. Chapters XI and XVI discuss the role of the aristocracy in determining the degree of power within a country. They also discuss the ways in which monarchs are influenced by their benefactors. Chapters XIII-16 discuss the military situation in Italy. The main issue is whether or not a person should be allowed to use his or her own forces to fight and win. In this case, it seems that the best way to defend against an enemy is to employ their own soldiers. For example, when Pope Julius II of England asked for aid from Spain, the Spanish responded by sending troops back to Italy with their own arms. Since then, however, they have turned to relying on mercenaries instead of their own personnel. ChAPTER XIV discusses the role of faith in princes. Chapter XV discusses the roles of men and women in relation to one another. Next up is Commodus. He inherited the empire from his father, Marcus, and was a brutal tyrant who killed a lot of people and then went on to rule for many more years. His son, Antoninus, was also a very good ruler, but after endless murders he eventually fell out of favor with the people because they hated him so much. Finally, there are several examples of princes making great fortunes by either arming or neglecting their subjects. The most recent example is the reign of Emperors Volumnio and Cambioli, both of whom were assassinated during the Civil War. These two examples illustrate how difficult it is for princes to do what they set out to do. In addition, some princes have been successful in overthrowing tyrannical kings; others fail miserably. Lastly, there is an important issue concerning the use of artificial intelligence in military planning. It can be used to help predict future events rather than to thwart them. Duke Valentino returns to Venice with his troops and prepares for war. He sends Oliverotto on a tour of Fano in November, then arranges for the Duke's forces to be stationed at an island called Sinigalia. The Dauphin is so impressed by this plan that he invites Oliverotto to join him as well. On December 31st, Di Gravina tells Oliverotto that they must leave Fano because it is too far away. They do manage to get there before the Duke has time to make any final decisions about what should happen to the men stationed there. In other words, don't let your friends know that you're planning to invade their country. Don Mello decides to go ahead and attack the Duke from two miles away. It turns out that the Duke doesn't want to defend his land; instead, he wants to use it as a breeding ground for guelph armies. After the battle ends, Di Lepio takes over as Lucca governor and becomes the new Pisan governor. Meanwhile, UguCCIO manages to take advantage of the chaos in Florence to try and seize control of Pistolio, which now belongs to the Giuseppi family. This is all very interesting stuff, but we'll stick with it for now. advertisement",0.25586744848819826,0.096491226
The Confession," In 1998, Travis Boyette abducted and raped Nicole ""Nikki"" Yarber, a teenage girl and high school student in Slone, Texas and buried her body in Joplin, Missouri some 6 hours from Slone. He watches unfazed as the police arrest and convict Donté Drumm, a black high school football player with no connection with the crime. Despite his innocence, Drumm is convicted and sentenced to death. He has been on death row for nine years when the story takes place.

","The Confession In July of this year, Mary writes to the real estate agent asking if she will use her Benton House. The agent tells her no, but then sends a note begging her to use it for the summer. She says that she hopes they will rent it out and asks if there is any way she can afford it. When Miss Emily comes to visit on August 24, Maggie starts chasing after a fly in the front yard. They fight over who gets to pick it up first. Maggie also tries to throw some peonies at Miss Emily while she is doing laundry. On August 29, Maggie calls back saying that she needs to call Staley because she has been keeping track of all the family's mail. A few days later, Maggie returns with news that Maggie has burned down the telephone pole outside their house. That same day, Agnes sees Miss Emily again. This time Maggie throws the peony onto the cobblestone floor instead of using the broom-climbing method previously employed by Miss Em. Maggie leaves without telling Agnes what happened. Agnes decides not to go through with the plan--she'll just have to figure out how to fix it herself. During the afternoon, Maggie appears with a jar of jelly and Agnes asks her to help her. Maggie tells Agnes that she has discovered a scrap of note under a telephone stand. Maggie also says that she will show Agnes how she got the note from Miss Emily when she returns later that day; Agnes does not believe Maggie's story until later in the evening. Maggie leaves without saying another word about the note or the missing piece of paper. The next day, Agnes learns that Carlo died on May 27, 1911 -- five years after he was buried. Maggie explains that this is because Miss Emily took the family Bible as a keepsake and used it to decorate her dresser. Maggie then goes upstairs to get some lemonade while Agnes works on her sewing machine. She finds remnants of old schoolbooks in the bottom of the closet. Maggie claims that the books must have come from somewhere else. Agnes decides to go downstairs and inspect the room for signs of madness. It turns out that the place where Mr. Benton supposedly committed the murder is now occupied by Maggie--a woman whose name Maggie had picked up at the post office several days earlier. Maggie comes back later to tell Agnes all about the case. The next morning, Agnes discovers that the books have been left in Staley's house overnight. She also learns that a telephone call has been coming in and out at night. The narrator believes that this is all part of Sprague's plan to murder Emily. Willie comes in and tells Agnes that he overheard Miss Emily asking for help. He says that she needs help from someone else. Maggie asks if she can go away with them so that they don't have to worry about Miss Em anymore. When Maggie leaves, Anne runs into her on the porch. They talk for a few minutes before Maggie goes off to find the missing book. Later, Maggie finds an envelope containing a signed letter written by Anne Bullards. It turns out to be a confession from Emily saying that she will not read the note because it is too long ago. Anne dies trying to get past the guilt of having helped Miss Emily when she was alive. In retrospect, we realize that Annie Bullards death was probably due to some combination of impulse and habitation. advertisement",0.49863544735881926,0.1552106387176072
Joseph and His Friend: A Story of Pennsylvania," Joseph, a young man, marries a wealthy woman just as he is discovering an even more powerful love with his new friend Philip and must contend with the revelation of his wife's manipulative nature as well as his increasing feelings for Philip.
","In this chapter, we learn that Joseph has been invited to a party at the home of his friend, Anna Warringiner. While there, he tells Rachel Miller that he is going to attend the party because it is a celebration of an old man who has died. Rachel says that she does not want to interfere in the planning of the party; instead, she wants to show him how much she cares for him. After the party ends, Rachel asks Elwood if he would like to meet her. He replies that he would rather touch her than kiss anyone else. The next evening, they have another party, and everyone attends. It turns out that when Elwood rides home from the party with Anna, Lucy takes over as hostess. She invites all the guests to come back later that night so that she can spend more time with her new husband. They all agree to go, and Elwood happily obliges. During the second party, though, Joseph finds himself sitting next to Lucy on the porch. He notices that she looks slightly disheveled, which makes him wonder why she is there. When they arrive at Asten Farm, the women are greeted by Miss Blessing and her daughter, Anna. She tells them all that she has been doing housekeeping for the last half-a-century . Miss Blessing is surprised to see how well Rachel meshes with people in town; she thinks it's just a matter of time before things start to heat up again. The following day, Joseph rides over to visit his friend, asking him if he knows anything about love. He says yes, but that he doesn't yet know whether Lucy has an affair with Joseph or not. When Joseph returns home, he asks Mr. Gardiner if he can help him plan the party for the next night. After much coaxing, Joseph finally agrees to help. During the party, Joseph finds himself sitting next to Julia, who reminds him of ""the mitten I once saw."" They have a moment of awkwardness before continuing on their way together. But then Elwood whispers to Joseph that he wants to know if Lucy has feelings for Joseph. Joseph admits that he does, but refuses to elaborate further until after the guests have left. The wedding is scheduled for October. Joseph goes to the Blessing home in order to meet Julia and her parents. There, he meets a handsome young man who reminds him of B. Blessing , his father's famous portrait. The two men begin talking about their upcoming marriage; they are both eager to get started on their new life together. They also discuss the possibility of having a son or daughter someday. Julia says that she would like to ""be beautiful,"" but Joseph tells her that she will have to learn how to handle her duties as a governess first. Afterward, Joseph takes a seat at the dining room table next to Philip, who has just returned from Europe. He asks Philip if he can borrow some money to buy a small farmhouse so that they can build a family there. Philip declines, saying that he wants to wait until after the wedding before making any decisions. Joseph agrees to help Philip with the purchase of the farmhouse because it is located near Julia's parents' house. When Philip leaves, Joseph realizes that he is more than Phillip's suitor. Joseph tells Elwood that he has decided to get married, and Elwood is surprised. Joseph says that he loves Julia, but that Julia isn't likely to live with them. Philip asks Joseph why he didn't just ask him to marry Julia; Joseph replies that he wanted to help Julia become a better wife. Philip writes back saying that he's happy about the marriage because Julia will soon be joining the family there as his wife. The wedding takes place two months later. In September, Joseph goes to visit Philip at the Blessing home in Coventry. He meets Philip, who introduces himself as Mr. Borchardt, an old friend of Philip's. They talk for a little bit before Philip leaves on his honeymoon. Soon after Philip departs, Joseph receives a letter from Julia telling him that her aunt and uncle are coming to their house so they can have a private wedding. She also mentions that she wants to know if Philip will be willing to let her use her name on the wedding registry. Joseph accepts the invitation without any further ado. On their honeymoon, Joseph finds it hard to put his finger on the right thing to say. When they arrive at the train station, Julia and Joseph are greeted warmly by their aunt Rachel Miller. Julia is eager to learn more about the farming industry and asks her Aunt Rachel if she can come over for a visit. She says that she will, but when Philip reminds her of how much he used to love her back in high school, Julia starts to question whether or not she really likes him. When Philip calls on Julia one day, she tells him that she has decided to visit the Hopeton family. Julia also tells Philip that she plans to work as a housekeeper for Mr. Holmwood's new company. The next day, Julia goes to meet Philip, who invites them over for dinner. Julia tries to convince Philip that there is something wrong with his mind, but Philip points out that it is all part of an ""adulterous habit of assuming false character"" . Julia finally convinces Philip that everything is fine--it was just a matter of time before someone else would be able to take care of it. Julia then introduces Philip to Julia. They talk for a few minutes before Julia heads off to have a drink together. Julia reveals that she took up carpentry instead of oil-related business ventures. It turns out that Philip had been involved in some sort of shady business deal involving Henry Tilson & Son , Inc., a well-to-do mining company. Julia feels guilty about being so judgmental toward everyone, especially Philip. Julia ends up spending most of her time with Philip and Lucy. The Bare Truth Philip tells Julia that he is in love with her and asks her not to mention it to Philip. She responds by saying that she has no interest in romantic fancies and will only obey Philip's wishes. Philip agrees to help, but when they talk more about the oil business, Philip says that he does not want to be associated with such an immoral man. Philip also admits that he once had a crush on her, but now he feels guilty for having hurt her so badly. Philip then goes off to visit Philip at the forge. He meets up with Mr. Holmwood, who is helping him finish his carpentry business. They have a heart-to-heart and are very happy together. Joseph brings back memories of their time together as children. The narrator gives us a brief account of some of the events of the past few weeks. It turns out that Elwood was right about one thing: Lucy must learn to love again. Mr. Blessing writes Joseph a note saying that he needs money to pay off the remaining balance of the loan. He also tells Joseph that he can sell some of his stock at once, as long as he sees Mr. Johnsons successor in town. Joseph agrees to this plan, and takes a train ride to the Chesapeake Bay. While on the way, Philip comes up against a walled-off section of the forest where he will spend most of his time fishing for trout. The narrator gives us a brief account of Philip and Julia's relationship: they are both very much in love with each other despite their differences in social class. Philip asks Joseph if he can travel with him to see the Hopetonys' oil wells. Joseph says yes, but only because he wants to be able to help them escape the clutches of ""the evil"" of society. After Philip leaves, Lucy realizes that she is beginning to suspect her husband of an ulterior motive. In the meantime, Joseph goes to look for oil in the area. He finds a well with a skeleton in it, but no one else has seen or heard of it. There's also a smoldering old man who asks Joseph questions about his business prospects. When Joseph tells him that he'll find out soon enough, the man is furious and storms off. The next day, Joseph takes Lucy home from the Well. Julia tries to cheer up her husband by telling him all about what happened on the wedding day. She can't help but feel guilty at the thought of ruining his already good-for-nothing wife. But she manages to keep herself together while still being able to be nice to Joseph. When the doctor arrives, he tells Joseph that Julia committed suicide by hanging herself. The family is shocked and concerned at the discovery of a poison in Julia's body. Philip begs for help finding out what happened to Julia before she committed suicide. Philip says that it was a case of mistaken identity but adds that there may be other suspects in the neighborhood as well. Philip also suggests that they get some more time off from work so that they can figure out who Julia really is. Philip then goes to tell Elwood about the arsenic found in Mrs. Bennet's jewelry box. When Philip returns home, all are quiet except for Mr. Holmwood, who has just returned from his walk with Rachel. Philip wants to make sure that no one finds anything incriminating in this case. They decide to go to town on legal aid and ask their local lawyer, Rachel Miller . Meanwhile, Philip tries to convince Madeline not to press charges against him. But Madeline will have none of it. Philip finally agrees to help them. The trial draws near. Philip is busy gathering the evidence and preparing it for publication in the paper. He consults Mr.Pinkerton, who will give testimony on the basis of what they have learned so far. The first witness is a servant-girl who has been present when Julia falls down the stairs. She tells Lucy that she witnessed Julia's reaction to the arsenic before her death; she also says that she went to see the man who had bought the poison at the drugstore after his marriage with Mrs. Lienicum. When asked by Pinkerton if he knows where the store where the poisoned arsenic was found, he states that he does not know. The jury then hears testimony from Benjamin Blessing , the doctor who testified against Joseph. They pronounce him innocent but sentence him to serve as their last witness. Dr. Pernelle notes that there are still many questions to be answered regarding the source of the arsenic, but concludes that the case is closed. The next day, Joseph takes Philip on a tour of the area. He tells Philip that he will be returning to Prescott in a year's time. Philip agrees and they head off to have a drink together. On the way home, Philip asks Rachel if she would like to invite her sister and herself over for tea with him. Rachel accepts gratefully. Philip is so happy that he almost faints from joy at the thought of being reunited with his old friend. They sit down and talk for a bit before Philip goes back to work. Philip says that he wants to know more about the mining industry. The narrator notes that Philip has learned a lot from listening to Madeline Bledsoe--he knows what it means to be a successful businessman but still doesn't realize how much money Philip has left behind. Philip also mentions that he hopes to one day marry Eliza. In the meantime, Philip receives a telegram from Elizabeth Spelman inviting him to visit her family in California. Philip promises to do so. advertisement",0.12253057692461326,0.058988763084837775
Dawn," 14-year-old Dawn Longchamp leads a humble, rootless existence with her parents, Ormond and Sally Jean Longchamp, and her moody older brother Jimmy, who is 16-years-old. Moving around a lot, Dawn's family does not provide much stability for her, but what her lifestyle lacks in stability, her home life makes up for in love. This erratic lifestyle seems to change when Dawn and Jimmy are able to enroll in an exclusive private school when Ormond gets a job there. It is here that Dawn's talent for singing is discovered. Her brother does not enjoy the school, feeling the weight of class differences bear down upon him. Dawn, although optimistic, does not fare much better, and is sternly ordered by the headmistress to be on her best behavior as she is of lesser social status than her classroom peers. On her first day, she also incurs the wrath of the most popular and affluent girl in the school, Clara Sue Cutler, after accidentally ratting her out on her smoking. Clara Sue then proceeds to pull mean-spirited pranks on Dawn and openly refers to her as white trash. Deeply offended, Dawn finally stops trying to like Clara Sue after this insult. However, Clara Sue's older brother, the handsome and charming Philip Cutler, does not share his sister's loathing. Phillip is kind to Dawn, and immediately shows an interest in her. He compares her beauty to that of his mother, Laura Sue Cutler, and is easily entranced. Jimmy is wary of Phillip, but does not overtly oppose Dawn's involvement with him. A shy girl who has had a sheltered upbringing, Dawn is somewhat taken aback by Phillip's immediate romantic overtures, even though she does find him attractive. Phillip urges her to date him, and after constant persuasion from him, Dawn agrees. Meanwhile, Dawn's mother, Sally Jean, has discovered that she is pregnant. This strains the Longchamps' finances, which are already tight, but Dawn is still overjoyed at the prospect of a little sibling, hoping that the baby will look more like her. Sally Jean gives birth to a little girl named Fern, but does not recover her health after the labor. She attempts several holistic ways of recovering her health but to no avail. She remains bedridden for the duration of Dawn's school year. At school, Dawn is excited by the musical opportunities now opening up to her. Her enjoyment of music culminates in her solo song, Somewhere over the Rainbow, at a school concert. Although nervous because of a prank pulled earlier by Clara Sue and her clique, Dawn draws emotional strength from the pearl necklace Sally Jean gave her earlier in the evening, which she claims are a Longchamp heirloom. Dawn's world comes crashing down after her solo performance at the school concert. Her beloved mother, Sally Jean, passes away that night. With the shock of this barely registered, what comes on the heels of Sally Jean's death truly changes Dawn's life forever. A security guard at the hospital where Sally Jean died recognizes the family, and also notices something peculiar in Dawn's appearance. He goes to the authorities, who perform an early morning raid of the Longchamp residence. Through these officers, it is revealed to Dawn that she is not Ormond and Sally Jean's biological daughter, but that she was kidnapped by them as a newborn baby, and that she is actually the daughter of Randolph and Laura Sue Cutler. Dawn is taken back to Cutler's Cove, Virginia, an offshoot of Virginia Beach. Ormond is arrested for child kidnapping. With no nearby relatives to come to their aid, Jimmy and Fern are placed in foster care. Dawn refuses to believe that Ormond kidnapped her, but the authorities prove her identity through a unique birthmark she shares with the description of the kidnapped baby. Dawn is appalled at the realization that the terrible Clara Sue is her sister; even worse, her boyfriend, Phillip, is actually her brother. These concerns fade into the background after her first meeting with Grandmother Cutler at the family's hotel, also named Cutler's Cove. Grandmother Cutler does not seem overjoyed about the return of her long-lost grandchild. She informs Dawn that she will be known by her ""true"" name, Eugenia, and that she will work in the hotel as a maid in order to prove that she is trustworthy. Dawn is shocked and upset by this cold treatment. She tries appealing to her real parents, Randolph and Laura Sue, but they are just as powerless as her. Randolph, though charming and handsome, has little willpower and prefers life to be as smooth as possible. Laura Sue is enchanted by Dawn's prettiness and resemblance to her, but refuses to make any effort to help her, as she is completely cowed by her mother-in-law. Dawn is also put at risk by Clara Sue's malicious tricks. Infuriated by Dawn's return, she does her best to make sure Dawn is fired by stealing jewellery and other items from the hotel guests. Dawn finds some comfort in the housekeeper, Mrs. Boston, who knew Sally Jean and Ormond Longchamp when they worked at the hotel. She cannot believe that her parents stole her, as they were always honest, hard-working people. Mrs. Boston hints that there is more to the ""kidnapping"" than meets the eye. Dawn's life is further brightened by a secret visit from Jimmy, aided and abetted by Phillip. Jimmy confesses that he has been in love with Dawn since they were children, but never dared show it because he felt he was sick for thinking of her that way. Dawn admits the attraction is mutual, but they find it hard to overcome their upbringing as brother and sister. This happy interlude comes to an end when Clara Sue finds Jimmy in the basement, where Dawn hid him. She tells Grandmother Cutler, who goes to the police and has Jimmy taken back to his foster parents. Dawn is heart-broken that Jimmy has to leave and is furious with Clara Sue. Jealous of her obvious affection for Jimmy, Phillip corners Dawn in her bathroom and rapes her. Desperate to get out, Dawn visits Mrs. Dalton, the woman who took care of her just after she was born, and learns that her ""kidnapping"" was staged by Grandmother Cutler because Randolph was not her biological father, as her mother had extramarital affairs, and didn't want a non-Culter child to receive benefits from the family. The Longchamps were paid with family jewels, including Dawn's pearls, to keep them quiet and to provide for Dawn and Jimmy. Outraged, Dawn confronts Grandmother Cutler about this. The old woman eventually agrees that she was the instigator and makes Dawn a deal: if Dawn will go to a singing school in New York, she will get Ormond out of prison. Dawn agrees but on one condition: that she be referred to by Dawn, not Eugenia. The book ends with Dawn going to New York.
","The chapter opens with a description of George and Philip. George is very angry at his cousin for lying to him about how much money he had spent at the Roussillon fair. Philip tries to defend himself, but George continues to fight like a wounded rat. The scene ends with George's head badly bled by George's blood-curdling blow. Philip tells his father that he will tell George all about what went down at the fair because George has promised not to tell anyone else about it anymore. Philip then goes off to work as a professional lifeguard for a wealthy family called the Bratham Estate. He meets Maria Lee, an eighteen-year-old country girl who works as a housekeeper for the estate. They go out together on a tour of the estate when they run into her. She invites them to have lunch with her, which Philip declines. Later in the day, Philip runs into Maria again, this time accompanied by another handsome young man named Philip. Philip meets Hilda at the train station. She tells him that she has just returned from France and is going to live with Philip in Roxham, Essex. They talk for a few moments before Maria comes running up to them. He asks her if she remembers Grumps wedding vows. She says no, because she wants to see George Cares-Dulcimer first. When Maria leaves, Philip realizes that he will never marry her unless he finds out what happened between her and Maria. He decides to tell Hilda about his affair with Maria when he returns home. The next time he goes to visit Maria, they are interrupted by Mrs. Bingleys last letter. This makes Philip even more determined to break off their engagement. The Squire tells Philip that he must marry Hilda because she is his daughter. Philip agrees to the marriage, but before he can tell Mrs. Baresfoot or Maria how upset he is at the thought of losing their inheritance. The Squire informs Philip that they will have a dinner party next week. He invites everyone to come along and has them all dine in his magnificent banquet hall. When Philip arrives home, he finds Hilda waiting for him with her butcher-girl friend, Sally. They talk for a long time until Philip finally gets tired of talking and goes off to bed. On May 20, Philip receives a letter informing him that Hildenree has been engaged to Philip's cousin, Maria von Holtzmanhausen; this makes Philip even more determined to destroy her. Pigott takes Hilda to meet her father, but before they can begin their conversation, Philip reveals that he has not yet decided whether or not to marry. His father is shocked and angry at the news of Maria Lee's death, which devastates his already ruined reputation. He also tells Philip that he will be paying a heavy tribute to Maria for her services in the coming years. Philip then goes to visit his dying father. When he arrives home, he finds Mr. Burlingame lying on the bed with his head propped up on a pillow. The next morning, when Philip returns from the hospital, he discovers that Hilda has died. Her body has been washed away by an accidental drowning; she has left behind all her money and possessions. Philip realizes that this means that he now has no one to take care of him. Mr. Fraser tells her that he has found a way to assert his authority over her. He wants the letters she promised him, which are now in the possession of someone else. She responds by saying that she does not care what people think of her and that she would never want to give them back if they were to betray her. This annoys Mr.Fraser so much that he decides to go for a walk with her one day. On the way, he happens upon a small girl whom he introduces as Angela Caredfoot. She is about nine years old and very beautiful looking. The narrator gives us a brief description of her: she is tall, dark, handsome, and generally pleasant. Her hair is twisted into knots, her eyes are large, her face is full of fine hair, and everything seems to be perfectly proportionate to her complexion. In this short scene, we get a brief account of the life of Angela from Chapter XVI to XXVI. George reveals to his wife that he wants her to help him sell the estate to George so that he can have it back before he dies. George also reveals that Arthur has a ward named Arthur who is in love with a raven-dog named Snarlyow. Arthur decides to visit George on his twenty-first birthday, hoping to find out what George plans to do about the matter. He goes off to dinner and meets up with some of his old school friends, including Mr. Brownlow. They talk for a bit and then go their separate ways. George introduces himself as Arthur Pheigham, nephew of Captain Donnithorne. Arthur asks George if he will write to Borley or tell him how the Jottley mortgage is being handled. George accepts Arthur's offer without hesitation. Arthur tells George all about his adventures in India and proposes to take a fishing trip there the following day. The narrator notes that Arthur spends most of his time at home reflecting on his own life. At 3.00am, George comes to visit the Burdens. He tells them that his father has invited him to stay for a few days and asks if they would like to have a room set up at Abbey House before he goes back to work. They are not sure whether George will accept or not, but eventually George agrees. When George returns from walking in the woods, he finds Angela sitting with Philip by her side. She is upset because she does not want George to see her. George tries to get her to tell him more about her past, but when she says that she wants to marry someone, he makes her go into a frenzy of laughter. George finally convinces her that this is what life should be like. The next day, Arthur takes George away on a trip to the Isle of Wight. On the way there, he meets Philip, whom he calls ""the most disconsolate of  ersatz  beings. Philip explains that he believes that all men should live according to their first principles: 1) first principles; 2) first-duties; 3) first aid; 4) education; 5) social consideration; 6) an honorable marriage; 7) any obstacle except death Angela and Arthur discuss old-fashioned superstition: they believe that the world is governed by a single supreme law, i.e., that there are no limits to what one can live or die upon. Arthur tells her about his own experiences with George, which include seeing figures on a tree in full view of him during daylight. He also explains that he has seen figures crawl up the side of the wall at night. The narrator notes that this scene was part of an ode to Greek tragedy, entitled A Storm on the Strings. This scene illustrates how much Arthur loves Angela. They go for a walk together near the ruins of their mother's house. Arthur asks her if she thinks he is foolish; she replies that she does not think so. She then goes on to tell him about all the wonderful things she has learned from studying classical literature under Dr. Barlow. When they arrive back at the abbey, Arthur takes her out for a tour of some of the ruined mounds of ancient graves. Afterward, they sit down to have a private conversation. Lord Bellamy tells Philip that he must go to see his cousin, George, and tell him about the proposal for sale of Isleworth land. Lord Bellamy wants to know if Philip will be okay with it, but Philip says that he has no interest in it at all. He adds that George is too young to marry Angela, which would make her unsuitable for a married man like Philip. The two lovers agree to meet again on the morning of their wedding. Philip arrives home late from church, and when he gets there, he finds Arthur waiting for him outside the house. Arthur asks Philip whether he can consent to Philip and Angela's engagement. Philip agrees; they sit down to have a private chat before Philip goes back to work. After Philip leaves, Arthur receives a mysterious letter from Anne asking him to reconsider his decision to propose to his daughter. It states that Philip must notify his father by ten oclock the next morning or else forfeit the entire amount of money he had invested in the marriage. In the meantime, Philip reads the letter and decides to accept the proposal. When the chapter ends, we jump forward to a flashback to a young English woman who was living in London at the time of Captain Donnithorne's death. The narrator tells us that this is Mildred J. Carr , an old, well-to-do doctor whose daughter Mildred is now twenty-one years old. Her father had died five years before and left her with nothing but his fortune. When he dies, she has no one to propose to. Instead, she decides to go on a trip called Madeira . On the way back to England, Arthur meets up with two other passengers from Madeira: Agatha Reddy and Mrs. Carrasco; they are both looking for something to talk about when they arrive in England. Arthur goes to the cabin of a ship bound for Madeiras, where he finds himself befriended by Annie Terry, whom he adores dearly. He also meets Agatha Crabtree, who seems to be interested in beetles as much as he does in butterflies. They spend some time together, enjoying each other very much. Mildred Carr introduces Arthur to his new love, the ""fairy queen of Madeira."" He is introduced to Mildred and her pet beetle, which reminds him of a dead man. She also introduces him to Miss Terry who tells him that she has caught an angel named Flicit. They go into a large room with six sphinx-shaped figures sitting on pedestals; they are surrounded by statues of Egyptian gods, fairies, and royal babies. The sight of all these beauties makes Arthur fall in love even more deeply with George. When he asks her about George, she says that he is only interested in marrying her cousin because it would make sense for him to marry her. Later, when Lord Bellamy visits Madeira as part of his business trip, he tries to convince her not to marry George but instead accepts her as his daughter's suitor if she can win George's consent. George offers to buy all of Isleworth if George marries Angela. Philip accepts, but George asks for a certain amount of money in order to get the property back. George says that he only has one thing on his mind: marriage. George is shocked when he hears about this offer from George and realizes that it will almost ruin him. George tells George that he wants to marry Angie sooner rather than later. George then tries to persuade her to promise not to throw away so much love as he offers. But she refuses. George gets angry at George for making such a big deal out of nothing. The next day, Lady Bhaer receives a mysterious letter from George asking her to help him find someone who can take care of his dying mother. She also informs George that they need to contact Madeira immediately because Sir John plans to go there soon. Lord Minster comes to visit the Carr family. He tells them that Mildred is engaged to be married to a rich, career-oriented man named Mr.Heigham. They all go out for a bite of lunch and then head back to the cottage. There they meet Lady Florence and her husband, who have just returned from Madeira after ten days on the island. The narrator gives us some brief background information about Mildred: she is forty years old, has a ton of hair, wears a peaked hat, and loves flowers. She also has a tendency to overindulge people in general, which makes her an unsuitable match for Prime Minister or President of the United States. In Chapter XLIV, we learn that Sir John Catherines and his wife are having a conversation with Lord Minsters while walking down a steep hillside. Arthur asks if this is where he can see Angels? Lady Florence says it is close to home. Lord Bellamy explains that he fights for his own hand and by himself. He wants to help Arthur, but will not allow himself to be separated from this beautiful woman. Lord Bellamy then tells Arthur that he has a friend named Lady Barlow whom he can rely on to keep him going. The friendship is cemented as the Bellams' visit ends in Madeira. On Christmas Eve, they return to their rented home after spending eight weeks there. They arrive back at Islay and are greeted by Sir John who asks them to come over for dinner. When they do so, Lady Carverley makes an all-out effort to get them to agree to meet up with her again next year. She also suggests that they have a drink together. Meanwhile, Lady Crabtree talks incessantly about how much fun it would be if she could just go out with Arthur every once in a while. In fact, one day when they are walking around the grounds of Islay, Lady Carr invites them over for a drink. As they sit down to have another drink, Lady Cruncherley accidentally drops a piece of emerald pebbled above her ear. It catches her eye and causes her to freak out. Before she can stop herself, Lady Curtainley calls out to Arthur asking him to kiss her. Arthur does not respond, Angela and her companions go to church and then have lunch. The Bellamy house is hit by a huge rock, which knocks over a life size marble statue that sits on a rock waiting for its fate. Lady Beadles comes in looking for the Bellamy family. She tells them that they can visit their father at Bratham Abbey if they wish. They do not want to because of the rumors floating around about Arthur's death. Meanwhile, Philip receives a letter from his cousin George telling him that he wants to marry Angie. He also learns that George has contracted galloping consumption, an illness that will prevent him from inheriting the estate once it is passed to future generations. This news troubles both Philip and Angelo, who feel betrayed by this news. In the meantime, Mrs. Bellamy writes to say that she too would like to get married but that she cannot as long as George is alive. It turns out that George had been planning to move to warmer climate where he could be closer to his father. The next morning, George and Angie are married. They leave for Madeira to have their marriage annulled three hours later. On his way home, he stops at a registry office so that he can get the divorce papers signed by Mrs. Fraser. He tells her that if she does not marry him immediately, they will lose the estate. She protests vehemently, saying that she would rather die in childbirth than be buried alive. The following day, as dawn breaks, Arthur sneaks back to Isleworth where he has just witnessed the wedding of Angela and Clipper. When he arrives, he finds out that George is watching him from across the road. This makes him even more determined to kill George. On his way back from London, he stops to see the aftermath of George and Annie's wedding. He tells her about the Heigham-Heigham conspiracy and how George drowned in the lake after being thrashed by a Bulldog on the wedding day. She becomes hysterical at the idea of having to defend herself against such a fearsome beast. When George dies, she will no longer be penniless but will go to live as an outcast. The next morning, when Sir John leaves for Madeira , he meets up with old Sam Borley, who has just returned from London. They are both very happy to see each other. Later that night, they meet Mildred, who explains to them that she is returning home because she had been waiting for him all along. The next evening Mildred tells Arthur that she has learned a lesson. She says that he should pity Angie for the way she treated him, especially since she knows that he would have rejected her if she had married someone else. Arthur responds by saying that he does not care what people think of him now because he is doing what he wants to do. He then goes on to tell about his yacht, the Evening Star, and how it was used to transport goods between Madeira and Spain. When they arrive in Madeira, there is an inquest into the death of Mrs. Fraser caused by faulty wine-guzzling. The only thing that can be done is to put all the pieces together so that no one will ever suspect or believe that Angela committed suicide. However, Dr. William Williamson, a young practitioner who studies aging men, finds out that Annie died from consumption at sea. This news makes Arthur even more determined to marry her. Angela goes to visit her father, who is still in a mental state. He tells her that he will not allow her to go back to Abbey House as long as she does not kill herself. She leaves him and goes to the house of Madame Bellamy where she learns that Arthur has gone with another woman named Mademoiselle Carr. The narrator gives us a brief account of what happened between them when they were both children. They are married and live in Madeira on the island of Madeira for three years. On the way home, Arthur tells Mildred that he is going to marry her. When they arrive at Madeira on their honeymoon, a letter arrives from his lawyer saying that he has been granted leave to live in England for a year and a half. This means that he will never see her again. He asks her if she would like to marry him. She says no, because she doesn't want to divorce him. They have an argument about whether or not they should get married. The narrator gives us some more background information about Mildred's relationship with Arthur. In Chapter XXIV, Arthur returns home after taking a long day out of business. He goes to visit Mildred but finds her sitting on a museum veranda instead of where he expected her to be when he left her there. He kisses her passionately and then dies. A few days later, while walking along the moors near the ruins of a Roman ship, he meets a beautiful woman whom he adores. He recognizes her as his old friend Angie Cares Foot. He proposes marriage to her without any strings attached. All three of them agree to do it. advertisement",1.477672407762834,0.21832883641792789
The Prince," The work has a recognizable structure, for the most part indicated by the author himself, which can be summarized as follows. The Prince starts by describing the subject matter it will handle. In the first sentence Machiavelli uses the word ""state"" (Italian stato which could also mean ""status"") in order to neutrally cover ""all forms of organization of supreme political power, whether republican or princely"". The way in which the word state came to acquire this modern type of meaning during the Renaissance has been the subject of many academic discussions, with this sentence and similar ones in the works of Machiavelli being considered particularly important. Machiavelli said that The Prince would be about princedoms, mentioning that he has written about republics elsewhere (possibly referring to the Discourses on Livy although this is debated), but in fact he mixes discussion of republics into this in many places, effectively treating republics as a type of princedom also, and one with many strengths. More importantly, and less traditionally, he distinguishes new princedoms from hereditary established princedoms. He deals with hereditary princedoms quickly in Chapter 2, saying that they are much easier to rule. For such a prince, ""unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him"". , comparing to traditional presentations of advice for princes, stated that the novelty in chapters 1 and 2 is the ""deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom"". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. He thinks Machiavelli may have been influenced by Tacitus as well his own experience, but finds no clear predecessor for this. This categorization of regime types is also ""un-Aristotelian"" and apparently simpler than the traditional one found for example in Aristotle's Politics, which divides regimes into those ruled by a single monarch, an oligarchy, or by the people, in a democracy. He also ignores the classical distinctions between the good and corrupt forms, for example between monarchy and tyranny. points out that Machiavelli frequently uses the words ""prince"" and ""tyrant"" as synonyms, ""regardless of whether he speaks of criminal or non-criminal tyrants"". Xenophon, on the other hand, made exactly the same distinction between types of rulers in the opening of his Education of Cyrus where he says that, concerning the knowledge of how to rule human beings, Cyrus the Great, his exemplary prince, was very different ""from all other kings, both those who have inherited their thrones from their fathers and those who have gained their crowns by their own efforts"". Machiavelli divides the subject of new states into two types, ""mixed"" cases and purely new states. New princedoms are either totally new, or they are “mixed” meaning that they are new parts of an older state, already belonging to that prince. Machiavelli generalizes that there were several virtuous Roman ways to hold a newly acquired province, using a republic as an example of how new princes can act: *to install one's princedom in the new acquisition, or to install colonies of one's people there, which is better. *to indulge the lesser powers of the area without increasing their power. *to put down the powerful people. *not to allow a foreign power to gain reputation. More generally, Machiavelli emphasizes that one should have regard not only for present problems but also for the future ones. One should not “enjoy the benefit of time” but rather the benefit of one's virtue and prudence, because time can bring evil as well as good. In some cases the old king of the conquered kingdom depended on his lords. 16th century France, or in other words France as it was at the time of writing of the Prince, is given by Machiavelli as an example of such a kingdom. These are easy to enter but difficult to hold. When the kingdom revolves around the king, then it is difficult to enter but easy to hold. The solution is to eliminate the old bloodline of the prince. Machiavelli used the Persian empire of Darius III, conquered by Alexander the Great, to illustrate this point and then noted that the Medici, if they think about it, will find this historical example similar to the ""kingdom of the Turk"" (Ottoman Empire) in their time - making this a potentially easier conquest to hold than France would be. notes that this chapter is quite atypical of any previous books for princes. Gilbert supposed the need to discuss conquering free republics is linked to Machiavelli's project to unite Italy, which contained some free republics. As he also notes, the chapter in any case makes it clear that holding such a state is highly difficult for a prince. Machiavelli gives three options:- *Ruin them, like Rome destroyed Carthage, and also like Machiavelli says the Romans eventually had to do in Greece, even though they had wanted to avoid it. *Go to live there (or install colonies, if you are a prince of a republic). *Let them keep their own orders but install a puppet regime. But Machiavelli says this way is useless. Princes who rise to power through their own skill and resources (their ""virtue"") rather than luck tend to have a hard time rising to the top, but once they reach the top they are very secure in their position. This is because they effectively crush their opponents and earn great respect from everyone else. Because they are strong and more self-sufficient, they have to make fewer compromises with their allies. Machiavelli writes that reforming an existing order is one of the most dangerous and difficult things a prince can do. Part of the reason is that people are naturally resistant to change and reform. Those who benefited from the old order will resist change very fiercely. By contrast, those who stand to benefit from the new order will be less fierce in their support, because the new order is unfamiliar and they are not certain it will live up to its promises. Moreover, it is impossible for the prince to satisfy everybody's expectations. Inevitably, he will disappoint some of his followers. Therefore, a prince must have the means to force his supporters to keep supporting him even when they start having second thoughts, otherwise he will lose his power. Only armed prophets, like Moses, succeed in bringing lasting change. Machiavelli claims that Moses killed uncountable numbers of his own people in order to enforce his will. Machiavelli was not the first thinker to notice this pattern. Allan Gilbert wrote: ""In wishing new laws and yet seeing danger in them Machiavelli was not himself an innovator,"" because this idea was traditional and could be found in Aristotle's writings. But Machiavelli went much further than any other author in his emphasis on this aim, and Gilbert associates Machiavelli's emphasis upon such drastic aims with the level of corruption to be found in Italy. According to Machiavelli, when a prince comes to power through luck or the blessings of powerful figures within the regime, he typically has an easy time gaining power but a hard time keeping it thereafter, because his power is dependent on his benefactors' goodwill. He does not command the loyalty of the armies and officials that maintain his authority, and these can be withdrawn from him at a whim. Having risen the easy way, it is not even certain such a prince has the skill and strength to stand on his own feet. This is not necessarily true in every case. Machiavelli cites Cesare Borgia as an example of a lucky prince who escaped this pattern. Through cunning political maneuvers, he managed to secure his power base. Cesare was made commander of the papal armies by his father, Pope Alexander VI, but was also heavily dependent on mercenary armies loyal to the Orsini brothers and the support of the French king. Borgia won over the allegiance of the Orsini's followers with better pay and prestigious government posts. When some of his mercenary captains started to plot against him, he had them imprisoned and executed. When it looked like the king of France would to abandon him, Borgia sought new alliances. Finally, Machiavelli makes a point that bringing new benefits to a conquered people will not be enough to cancel the memory of old injuries, an idea Allan Gilbert said can be found in Tacitus and Seneca the Younger. Conquests by ""criminal virtue"" are ones in which the new prince secures his power through cruel, immoral deeds, such as the execution of political rivals. Machiavelli advises that a prince should carefully calculate all the wicked deeds he needs to do to secure his power, and then execute them all in one stroke, such that he need not commit any more wickedness for the rest of his reign. In this way, his subjects will slowly forget his cruel deeds and his reputation can recover. Princes who fail to do this, who hesitate in their ruthlessness, find that their problems mushroom over time and they are forced to commit wicked deeds throughout their reign. Thus they continuously mar their reputations and alienate their people. Machiavelli's case study is Agathocles of Syracuse. After Agathocles became Praetor of Syracuse, he called a meeting of the city's elite. At his signal, his soldiers killed all the senators and the wealthiest citizens, completely destroying the old oligarchy. He declared himself ruler with no opposition. So secure was his power that he could afford to absent himself to go off on military campaigns in Africa. remarks that this chapter is even less traditional than those it follows, not only in its treatment of criminal behavior, but also in the advice to take power from people at a stroke, noting that precisely the opposite had been advised by Aristotle in his Politics (5.11.1315a13). On the other hand Gilbert shows that another piece of advice in this chapter, to give benefits when it will not appear forced, was traditional. These ""civic principalities"" do not require real virtue, only “fortunate astuteness”. Machiavelli breaks this case into two basic types, depending upon which section of the populace supports the new prince. =====Supported by the great (those who wish to command the people)===== This, according to Machiavelli, is an unstable situation, which must be avoided after the initial coming to power. The great should be made and unmade every day at your convenience. There are two types of great people that might be encountered:- # Those who are bound to the prince. Concerning these it is important to distinguish between two types of obligated great people, those who are rapacious and those who are not. It is the latter who can and should be honoured. # Those who are not bound to the new prince. Once again these need to be divided into two types:- Those with a weak spirit. A prince can make use of them if they are of good counsel; Those who shun being bound because of their own ambition. These should be watched and feared as enemies. =====Supported by the people (those who wish not to be commanded by the great)===== How to win over people depends on circumstances. Machiavelli advises:- *Do not get frightened in adversity. *One should avoid ruling via magistrates, if one wishes to be able to “ascend” to absolute rule quickly and safely. *One should make sure that the people need the prince, especially if a time of need should come. The way to judge the strength of a princedom is to see whether it can defend itself, or whether it needs to depend on allies. This does not just mean that the cities should be prepared and the people trained. A prince who is hated is also exposed. This type of ""princedom"" refers for example explicitly to the Catholic church, which is of course not traditionally thought of as a princedom. According to Machiavelli, these are relatively easy to maintain, once founded. They do not need to defend themselves militarily, nor to govern their subjects. Machiavelli discusses the recent history of the Church as if it were a princedom that was in competition to conquer Italy against other princes. He points to factionalism as a historical weak point in the Church, and points to the recent example of the Borgia family as a better strategy which almost worked. He then explicitly proposes that the Medici are now in a position to try the same thing. Having discussed the various types of principalities, Machiavelli turns to the ways a state can attack other territories or defend itself. The two most essential foundations for any state, whether old or new, are sound laws and strong military forces. A self-sufficient prince is one who can meet any enemy on the battlefield. He should be ""armed"" with his own arms. However, a prince that relies solely on fortifications or on the help of others and stands on the defensive is not self-sufficient. If he cannot raise a formidable army, but must rely on defense, he must fortify his city. A well-fortified city is unlikely to be attacked, and if it is, most armies cannot endure an extended siege. However, during a siege a virtuous prince will keep the morale of his subjects high while removing all dissenters. Thus, as long as the city is properly defended and has enough supplies, a wise prince can withstand any siege. Machiavelli stands strongly against the use of mercenaries, and in this he was innovative, and he also had personal experience in Florence. He believes they are useless to a ruler because they are undisciplined, cowardly, and without any loyalty, being motivated only by money. Machiavelli attributes the Italian city states’ weakness to their reliance on mercenary armies. Machiavelli also warns against using auxiliary forces, troops borrowed from an ally, because if they win, the employer is under their favor and if they lose, he is ruined. Auxiliary forces are more dangerous than mercenary forces because they are united and controlled by capable leaders who may turn against the employer. The main concern for a prince should be war, or the preparation thereof, not books. Through war a hereditary prince maintains his power or a private citizen rises to power. Machiavelli advises that a prince must frequently hunt in order to keep his body fit and learn the landscape surrounding his kingdom. Through this, he can best learn how to protect his territory and advance upon others. For intellectual strength, he is advised to study great military men so he may imitate their successes and avoid their mistakes. A prince who is diligent in times of peace will be ready in times of adversity. Machiavelli writes, “thus, when fortune turns against him he will be prepared to resist it.” Each of the following chapters presents a discussion about a particular virtue or vice that a prince might have, and is therefore structured in a way which appears like traditional advice for a prince. However the advice is far from traditional. Machiavelli believes that a prince's main focus should be on perfecting the art of war. He believes that by taking this profession a ruler will be able to protect his kingdom. He claims that ""being disarmed makes you despised."" He believes that the only way to ensure loyalty from one's soldiers is to understand military matters. The two activities Machiavelli recommends practicing to prepare for war are physical and mental. Physically, he believes rulers should learn the landscape of their territories. Mentally, he encouraged the study of past military events. He also warns against idleness. Because, says Machiavelli, he wants to write something useful to those who understand, he thought it more fitting ""to go directly to the effectual truth (""verità effettuale"") of the thing than to the imagination of it"". This section is one where Machiavelli’s pragmatic ideal can be seen most clearly. The prince should, ideally, be virtuous, but he should be willing and able to abandon those virtues if it becomes necessary. Concerning the behavior of a prince toward his subjects, Machiavelli announces that he will depart from what other writers say, and writes: Since there are many possible qualities that a prince can be said to possess, he must not be overly concerned about having all the good ones. Also, a prince may be perceived to be merciful, faithful, humane, frank, and religious, but most important is only to seem to have these qualities. A prince cannot truly have these qualities because at times it is necessary to act against them. In fact, he must sometimes deliberately choose evil. Although a bad reputation should be avoided, it is sometimes necessary to have one. If a prince is overly generous to his subjects, Machiavelli asserts he will not be appreciated, and will only cause greed for more. Additionally, being overly generous is not economical, because eventually all resources will be exhausted. This results in higher taxes, and will bring grief upon the prince. Then, if he decides to discontinue or limit his generosity, he will be labeled as a miser. Thus, Machiavelli summarizes that guarding against the people’s hatred is more important than building up a reputation for generosity. A wise prince should be willing to be more reputed a miser than be hated for trying to be too generous. On the other hand: ""of what is not yours or your subjects' one can be a bigger giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander, because spending what is someone else's does not take reputation from you but adds it to you; only spending your own hurts you"". In addressing the question of whether it is better to be loved or feared, Machiavelli writes, “The answer is that one would like to be both the one and the other; but because it is difficult to combine them, it is far safer to be feared than loved if you cannot be both.” As Machiavelli asserts, commitments made in peace are not always kept in adversity; however, commitments made in fear are kept out of fear. Yet, a prince must ensure that he is not feared to the point of hatred, which is very possible. This chapter is possibly the most well-known of the work, and it is important because of the reasoning behind Machiavelli’s famous idea that it is better to be feared than loved – his justification is purely pragmatic; as he notes, “Men worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared.” Fear is simply a means to an end, and that end is security for the prince. The fear instilled should never be excessive, for that could be dangerous to the prince. Above all, Machiavelli argues, a prince should not interfere with the property of their subjects, their women, or the life of somebody without proper justification. Regarding the troops of the prince, fear is absolutely necessary to keep a large garrison united and a prince should not mind the thought of cruelty in that regard. For a prince who leads his own army, it is imperative for him to observe cruelty because that is the only way he can command his soldiers' absolute respect. Machiavelli compares two great military leaders: Hannibal and Scipio Africanus. Although Hannibal's army consisted of men of various races, they were never rebellious because they feared their leader. Machiavelli says this required ""inhuman cruelty"" which he refers to as a virtue. Scipio's men, on the other hand, were known for their mutiny and dissension, due to Scipio's ""excessive mercy"" - which was however a source of glory because he lived in a republic. Machiavelli notes that a prince is praised for keeping his word. However, he also notes that a prince is also praised for the illusion of being reliable in keeping his word. A prince, therefore, should only keep his word when it suits his purposes, but do his utmost to maintain the illusion that he does keep his word and that he is reliable in that regard. Therefore, a prince should not break his word unnecessarily. As Machiavelli notes, “He should appear to be compassionate, faithful to his word, guileless, and devout. And indeed he should be so. But his disposition should be such that, if he needs to be the opposite, he knows how.” As noted in chapter 15, the prince must appear to be virtuous, and should be virtuous, but he should be able to be otherwise when the time calls for it; that includes being able to lie, though however much he lies he should always keep the appearance of being truthful. Machiavelli observes that most men are content as long as they are not deprived of their property and women. A prince should command respect through his conduct, because a prince that is highly respected by his people is unlikely to face internal struggles. Additionally, a prince who does not raise the contempt of the nobles and keeps the people satisfied, Machiavelli assures, should have no fear of conspirators. Machiavelli advises monarchs to have both internal and external fears. Internal fears exist inside his kingdom and focus on his subjects, Machiavelli warns to be suspicious of everyone when hostile attitudes emerge. External fears are of foreign powers. Machiavelli mentions that placing fortresses in conquered territories, although it sometimes works, often fails. Using fortresses can be a good plan, but Machiavelli says he shall ""blame anyone who, trusting in fortresses, thinks little of being hated by the people"". A prince truly earns honor by completing great feats. King Ferdinand of Spain is cited by Machiavelli as an example of a monarch who gained esteem by showing his ability through great feats and who, in the name of religion, conquered many territories and kept his subjects occupied so that they had no chance to rebel. Regarding two warring states, Machiavelli asserts it is always wiser to choose a side, rather than to be neutral. Machiavelli then provides the following reasons why: * If your allies win, you benefit whether or not you have more power than they have. * If you are more powerful, then your allies are under your command; if your allies are stronger, they will always feel a certain obligation to you for your help. * If your side loses, you still have an ally in the loser. Machiavelli also notes that it is wise for a prince not to ally with a stronger force unless compelled to do so. In conclusion, the most important virtue is having the wisdom to discern what ventures will come with the most reward and then pursuing them courageously. The selection of good servants is reflected directly upon the prince’s intelligence, so if they are loyal, the prince is considered wise; however, when they are otherwise, the prince is open to adverse criticism. Machiavelli asserts that there are three types of intelligence: *The kind that understands things for itself—which is excellent to have. *The kind that understands what others can understand—which is good to have. *The kind that does not understand for itself, nor through others—which is useless to have. If the prince does not have the first type of intelligence, he should at the very least have the second type. For, as Machiavelli states, “A prince needs to have the discernment to recognize the good or bad in what another says or does even though he has no acumen himself"". This chapter shows a low opinion of flatterers; Machiavelli notes that “Men are so happily absorbed in their own affairs and indulge in such self-deception that it is difficult for them not to fall victim to this plague; and some efforts to protect oneself from flatterers involve the risk of becoming despised.” Flatterers were seen as a great danger to a prince, because their flattery could cause him to avoid wise counsel in favor of rash action, but avoiding all advice, flattery or otherwise, was equally bad; a middle road had to be taken. A prudent prince should have a select group of wise counselors to advise him truthfully on matters all the time. All their opinions should be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision should be made by the counselors and carried out absolutely. If a prince is given to changing his mind, his reputation will suffer. A prince must have the wisdom to recognize good advice from bad. Machiavelli gives a negative example in Emperor Maximilian I; Maximilian, who was secretive, never consulted others, but once he ordered his plans and met dissent, he immediately changed them. After first mentioning that a new prince can quickly become as respected as a hereditary one, Machiavelli says princes in Italy who had long standing power and lost it can not blame bad luck, but should blame their own indolence. One ""should never fall in the belief that you can find someone to pick you up"". They all showed: *A defect of arms, already discussed. *Either had a hostile populace or else they did not know to secure themselves with the great. As pointed out by it was traditional in the genre of Mirrors of Princes to mention fortune, but ""Fortune pervades The Prince as she does no other similar work"". Machiavelli argues that fortune is only the judge of half of our actions and that we have control over the other half with ""sweat"", prudence and virtue. Even more unusual, rather than simply suggesting caution as a prudent way to try to avoid the worst of bad luck, Machiavelli holds that the greatest princes in history tend to be ones who take more risks, and rise to power through their own labour, virtue, prudence, and particularly by their ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli even encourages risk taking as a reaction to risk. In a well-known metaphor, Machiavelli writes that ""it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because fortune is a woman; and it is necessary, if one wants to hold her down, to beat her and strike her down."" Gilbert (p.&nbsp;217) points out that Machiavelli's friend the historian and diplomat Francesco Guicciardini expressed similar ideas about fortune. Machiavelli compares fortune to a torrential river that cannot be easily controlled during flooding season. In periods of calm, however, people can erect dams and levees in order to minimize its impact. Fortune, Machiavelli argues, seems to strike at the places where no resistance is offered, as had recently been the case in Italy. As points out that what Machiavelli actually says is that Italians in his time leave things not just to fortune, but to ""fortune and God"". Machiavelli is indicating in this passage, as in some others in his works, that Christianity itself was making Italians helpless and lazy concerning their own politics, as if they would leave dangerous rivers un-controlled. Pope Leo X was pope at the time the book was written and a member of the de Medici family. This chapter directly appeals to the Medici to use what has been summarized in order to conquer Italy using Italian armies, following the advice in the book. showed that including such exhortation was not unusual in the genre of books full of advice for princes. But it is unusual that the Medici family's position of Papal power is openly named as something that should be used as a personal power base, as a tool of secular politics. Indeed takes the Borgia family's recent and very controversial attempts to use church power in secular politics, often very brutally executed, as a positive example. This continues a controversial theme throughout the book.
","The Prince is a historical account of the reign of Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici from 1513 until his death on June 22, 1527 at the age of eighty-five. The Prince was written in 1416 and 1617; it contains many references to classical antiquity, especially those relating to the period between 1494 and 1520. It also includes several references to the ""Prince"" , i.e. the man or the woman who controls the kingdom. In addition, the Prince has an important role in the formation of the Free Republic of Venice during the reigns of King Louis XIV and Henry VIII. Chapters VII and VIII discuss the different types of princes: those who rise from private citizens to become princes; those that fall under the influence of a powerful man or, more specifically, an aristocrat. Chapter VII discusses the three principalities of princes in terms of ability and fortune. In order to advance his goals, he first needs to establish a system of statehood for himself and his subjects before he can use it to impose his will on others. This is accomplished by overthrowing the tyrannical rule of the Roman Catholic Church. Chapters XI and XII discuss the roles of rulers and their advisors. The most important issue is the role played by monarchs during the reign of Alexander V, i.e., kings of Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and England. Chapters XI and XVI discuss the role of the aristocracy in determining the degree of power within a country. They also discuss the ways in which monarchs are influenced by their benefactors. Chapters XIII-16 discuss the military situation in Italy. The main issue is whether or not a person should be allowed to use his or her own forces to fight and win. In this case, it seems that the best way to defend against an enemy is to employ their own soldiers. For example, when Pope Julius II of England asked for aid from Spain, the Spanish responded by sending troops back to Italy with their own arms. Since then, however, they have turned to relying on mercenaries instead of their own personnel. ChAPTER XIV discusses the role of faith in princes. Chapter XV discusses the roles of men and women in relation to one another. Next up is Commodus. He inherited the empire from his father, Marcus, and was a brutal tyrant who killed a lot of people and then went on to rule for many more years. His son, Antoninus, was also a very good ruler, but after endless murders he eventually fell out of favor with the people because they hated him so much. Finally, there are several examples of princes making great fortunes by either arming or neglecting their subjects. The most recent example is the reign of Emperors Volumnio and Cambioli, both of whom were assassinated during the Civil War. These two examples illustrate how difficult it is for princes to do what they set out to do. In addition, some princes have been successful in overthrowing tyrannical kings; others fail miserably. Lastly, there is an important issue concerning the use of artificial intelligence in military planning. It can be used to help predict future events rather than to thwart them. Duke Valentino returns to Venice with his troops and prepares for war. He sends Oliverotto on a tour of Fano in November, then arranges for the Duke's forces to be stationed at an island called Sinigalia. The Dauphin is so impressed by this plan that he invites Oliverotto to join him as well. On December 31st, Di Gravina tells Oliverotto that they must leave Fano because it is too far away. They do manage to get there before the Duke has time to make any final decisions about what should happen to the men stationed there. In other words, don't let your friends know that you're planning to invade their country. Don Mello decides to go ahead and attack the Duke from two miles away. It turns out that the Duke doesn't want to defend his land; instead, he wants to use it as a breeding ground for guelph armies. After the battle ends, Di Lepio takes over as Lucca governor and becomes the new Pisan governor. Meanwhile, UguCCIO manages to take advantage of the chaos in Florence to try and seize control of Pistolio, which now belongs to the Giuseppi family. This is all very interesting stuff, but we'll stick with it for now. advertisement",0.023217399,0.19699325743340107
Emma," Emma Woodhouse, aged 20 at the start of the novel, is a young, beautiful, witty, and privileged woman in Regency England. She lives on the fictional estate of Hartfield in Surrey in the village of Highbury with her elderly widowed father, a hypochondriac who is excessively concerned for the health and safety of his loved ones. Emma's friend and only critic is the gentlemanly George Knightley, her neighbour from the adjacent estate of Donwell, and the brother of her elder sister Isabella's husband, John. As the novel opens, Emma has just attended the wedding of Miss Taylor, her best friend and former governess. Having introduced Miss Taylor to her future husband, Mr. Weston, Emma takes credit for their marriage, and decides that she rather likes matchmaking. Against Mr. Knightley's advice, Emma forges ahead with her new interest, and tries to match her new friend Harriet Smith, a sweet, pretty, but none-too-bright parlour boarder of seventeen &mdash;described as ""the natural daughter of somebody""&mdash; to Mr. Elton, the local vicar. Emma becomes convinced that Mr. Elton's constant attentions are a result of his attraction and growing love for Harriet. But before events can unfold as she plans, Emma must first persuade Harriet to refuse an advantageous marriage proposal. Her suitor is a respectable, educated, and well-spoken young gentleman farmer, Robert Martin, but Emma snobbishly decides he isn't good enough for Harriet. Against her own wishes, the easily-influenced Harriet rejects Mr. Martin. Emma's schemes go awry when Mr. Elton, a social climber, fancies Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. Emma's friends had suggested that Mr. Elton's attentions were really directed at her, but she had misread the signs. Emma, rather shocked and a bit insulted, tells Mr. Elton that she had thought him attached to Harriet; however Elton is outraged at the very idea of marrying the socially inferior Harriet. After Emma rejects Mr. Elton, he leaves for a while for a sojourn in Bath, and Harriet fancies herself heartbroken. Emma feels dreadful about misleading Harriet and resolves—briefly—to interfere less in people's lives. Mr. Elton, as Emma's misconceptions of his character melt away, reveals himself to be arrogant, resentful, and pompous. He soon returns from Bath with a pretentious, nouveau-riche wife who becomes part of Emma's social circle, though the two women soon loathe each other. The Eltons treat the still lovestruck Harriet deplorably, culminating with Mr Elton very publicly snubbing Harriet at a dance. Mr Knightley, who had until this moment refrained from dancing, gallantly steps in to partner Harriet, much to Emma's gratification. An interesting development is the arrival in the neighbourhood of the handsome and charming Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son, who had been given to his deceased wife's wealthy brother and his wife, the Churchills, to raise. Frank, who is now Mrs. Weston's stepson, and Emma have never met, but she has a long-standing interest in doing so. The whole neighborhood takes a fancy to him, with the partial exception of Mr. Knightley, who becomes uncharacteristically grumpy whenever his name is mentioned and suggests to Emma that while Frank is clever and engaging, he is also a rather shallow character. A third newcomer is the orphaned Jane Fairfax, the reserved, beautiful, and elegant niece of Emma's impoverished neighbour, the talkative Miss Bates, who lives with her deaf, widowed mother. Miss Bates is an aging spinster, well-meaning but increasingly poor; Emma strives to be polite and kind to her, but is irritated by her constant chattering. Jane, very gifted musically, is Miss Bates' pride and joy; Emma envies her talent, and although she has known Jane all her life has never warmed to her personally. Jane had lived with Miss Bates until she was nine, but Colonel Campbell, a friend of her father's, welcomed her into his own home, where she became fast friends with his daughter and received a first-rate education. But now Miss Campbell has married, and the accomplished but penniless Jane has returned to her Bates relations, ostensibly to regain her health and to prepare to earn her living as a governess. Emma is annoyed to find the entire neighborhood, including Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, singing Jane's praises, but when Mrs. Elton, who fancies herself the new leader of Highbury society, patronizingly takes Jane under her wing and announces that she will find her the ideal governess post, Emma begins to feel some sympathy for Jane's predicament. Still, Emma sees something mysterious in Jane's sudden return to Highbury and imagines that Jane and Miss Campbell's husband, Mr. Dixon, were mutually attracted, and that is why she has come home instead of going to Ireland to visit them. She shares her suspicions with Frank, who had become acquainted with Jane and the Campbells when they met at a vacation spot a year earlier, and he apparently agrees with her. Suspicions are further fueled when a piano, sent by an anonymous benefactor, arrives for Jane. Emma tries to make herself fall in love with Frank largely because almost everyone seems to expect it. Frank appears to be courting Emma, and the two flirt and banter together in public, at parties, and on a day-trip to Box Hill, a local beauty spot. However, when his demanding and ailing aunt, Mrs. Churchill, summons Frank home, Emma discovers she does not miss her ""lover"" nearly as much as she expected and sets about plotting a match between him and Harriet, who seems to have finally gotten over Mr. Elton. Harriet breathlessly reports that Frank has ""saved"" her from a band of Gypsies, and seems to be confessing her admiration for him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Weston wonders if Emma's old friend Mr. Knightley has taken a fancy to Jane. Emma immediately dismisses that idea and protests that she does not want Mr. Knightley to marry anyone, and that her little nephew Henry must inherit Donwell, the Knightley family property. When Mr. Knightley scolds her for a thoughtless insult to Miss Bates, Emma is stunned and ashamed and tries to atone by going to visit Miss Bates. Mr. Knightley is surprised and deeply impressed by Emma's recognition of her wrongdoing, but this meaningful rapprochement is broken off when he announces he must leave for London to visit his brother. Meanwhile, Jane reportedly becomes ill, but refuses to see Emma or accept her gifts, and it is suddenly announced that she has accepted a governess position from one of Mrs. Elton's friends. On the heels of this comes word that Frank Churchill's aunt has died, and with it the astonishing news that Frank and Jane have been secretly engaged since they first met on holiday a year ago. They had been keeping the engagement quiet because they knew that Frank's imperious aunt would disapprove and likely disinherit him if he went through with the match. The strain of the clandestine relationship had been much harder on the conscientious Jane than the carefree Frank, and the two had quarreled bitterly; but now that his aunt has died, his easygoing uncle has already given his blessing. The engagement becomes public, the secrets behind Jane and Frank's behavior are revealed, and Emma is chagrined to discover that once again she has been so wrong about so much. Emma is certain that Harriet will be devastated by Frank's engagement, but Harriet reassures her that this is not the case. In fact, Harriet tells Emma, it is Mr. Knightley who has captured her heart, and she believes he returns her feelings. Emma is dumbstruck over what she at first thinks is the impropriety of the match, but as she faces her feelings of dismay and jealousy, she realizes in a flash that she has long been in love with Mr. Knightley herself. She is shattered to think that it may be too late and resolves to support her dear friends in whatever they do, even at the cost of her own broken heart. However, when Mr. Knightley hurries back to Highbury to console Emma over what he imagines to be the loss of Frank Churchill, she discovers that he is also in love with her. He proposes and she joyfully accepts. There is one more match to be made: With encouragement from Mr. Knightley, the farmer Robert Martin proposes again to Harriet, and this time she accepts. Jane and Emma reconcile and all misunderstandings are cleared up before Jane and Frank leave for their wedding and life with his uncle in Yorkshire. Emma and Mr. Knightley decide that after their marriage they will live with Emma's father at Hartfield to spare Mr. Woodhouse loneliness and distress. They seem headed for a union of ""perfect happiness,"" to the great joy of their friends. Mrs. Weston gives birth to a baby girl, to the great satisfaction of Emma, who looks forward to introducing little Miss Weston to her young nephews.
","Miss Taylor Marriages Miss Taylor marries. Emma is saddened by the loss of this dear friend, and mourns her loss for a long time. On the wedding day, Emma remembers how much she loved Miss Taylor before she knew who she was. She also recalls how good it felt to be around Miss Taylor when she was younger. The only companion that Emma could find for Miss Taylors family was her father-in-law, who could not even meet her on the first day of their marriage. Emma then realizes that there must be some sort of relationship between these two people. Mr., Woodhouse is fond of all things social; he likes to have friends come visit him, including his daughter Harriet Smith. When Emma visits Hartfield one day, she meets Robert Martin, an old acquaintance of hers whose parents recently died. Emma learns that Frank Churchill is from a wealthy family with a thriving boarding school called Abbey Mill Farm. Although Emma does not yet know the identity of the Martin family, she thinks that they are well regarded among Highbury society Harriet Smith continues to make disparaging remarks about Emma and her friend Harriet Smith in Chapter VII. She criticizes Harriet for forgetting to buy the book she recommended, noting that Harriet will never be able to learn anything from her. Mr., Knightley also makes disparaging comments about Harriet as an inferior young woman; he even suggests that Harriet might not be so great a companion if she is forced to accept a marriage proposal. He then tells Emma that Robert Martin has written a letter proposing marriage, which Emma objects to because of its lack of grammatical or factual errors. The narrator continues to note that Knightley has no qualms about Harriet marrying Robert Martin; he just doesn't see the point in having Harriet marry a rich, well-respected man. The narrator also notes that Emma is not as opinionated as she once was regarding Harriet's parents; they are both educated by respectable families and do not allow young girls to marry out of wedlock. In fact, some of Knightley's strongest criticisms of Harriet fall on deaf ears. He criticizes Harriet for refusing Robert Martin because it would make her ""dementia"" . Mr. Dixon says that Harriet will never be happy until she finds a husband who can provide her with enough money to support herself and her family. Meanwhile, Emma writes a letter to Harriet thanking her for writing this letter. She then goes off to visit the Woodhouses, where she runs into Elton again. The Knightley-Knightley family arrives in Hartfield on their honeymoon. They spend the first day there with Isabella and her husband, accompanied by five children and nurserymaids. Emma tries to persuade them to stay longer so that they will not have to walk back home in such a daze. She also attempts to convince them that it is time for reconciliation. The next day Mr. George Knightley invites them all to dinner at his home, but he cannot bring himself to do so because of the extremely cold weather forecasted for the following day. During this visit, Emma overhears Mr. Churchill making disparaging remarks about Mrs. Gardiner and Harriet Smith. When she returns home, she finds out that Harriet has had a serious cold and needs urgent medical attention. In the midst of these unpleasant conversations, Emma listens to some of Elton's nonsense while listening to what he has to say. Emma starts to think about Frank Churchill again. She thinks that if she marries him, he will suit her well in terms of character and situation. Mr., Elton comes by for a visit. He apologizes for his drunkenness at the beginning of the chapter, but Emma tells him it was just a matter of time before he arrived. When he did arrive, he apologized profusely for his rudeness toward Harriet. They had planned to go out walking on Christmas Eve, but due to the snowfall, they were unable to do so. On their way home, Emma realizes that she has blunded the course of her relationship with Harriet. She tries to make Harriet feel as though she is somehow superior to her in talent and good-naturedness. In the end, she gives up trying to be nice to Harriet when she sees how miserable she is. Emma and Harriet call upon the Bateses to tell them that Jane Fairfax has been invited to visit them in Ireland. The Bateses, who are not wealthy, do not have much money, but they do have a daughter named Miss Bates whom they invite to stay with them for three months. Emma tells Harriet that she cannot forgive Jane for seduction because she is too reserved The next morning, Emma sees Frank Churchill on his way home from London. He is charming and well-dressed, but there is no love lost between them. They visit Randalls Inn, where Frank has been staying for the past few weeks. The innkeeper tells Emma that Frank admires her very much and wishes to see her again. Emma finds out that Frank plans to visit Highbury as soon as he can. Emma decides that she will not accept the invitation to visit the Cole family, even though they have invited her many times before. She is initially disappointed at the thought of going, but then she realizes that there are other reasons why she cannot go: Frank Churchill and Harriet Bates invite them over for dinner; Jane Fairfax is to appear on the evening's program; Frank Churchill speaks glowingly of Jane as a beautiful young woman who has no talent for singing or playing the piano. Emma overhears Frank speak glowingly about his admiration for Jane while he talks disparagingly of Jane. When Frank leaves, Emma asks him if he would like to see Jane again. He says that he would rather marry her than let her become an invalid because of her ill health. After Frank departs, Emma sees Frank sitting next to Jane in a carriage. They talk for a long time until Frank announces that he has made a love match between himself and Jane. Joining Frank and Jane at the piano shop, Emma learns that Frank Churchill has ordered additional supplies of apples for Jane to use. He also tells her that his mother cannot bear to eat because she is too preoccupied with worrying about what will become of her house when she grows old. When Frank departs, Emma asks him how he is doing; he responds by saying that he does not know yet whether he will be staying another week or not. Joining them in their shopping trip, Frank announces that he plans to return from Ireland on business next week. During this visit, Frank gives Emma a detailed description of his travels and suggests that they should have a ball instead of an inn where everyone dances. After Frank leaves, Emma realizes that there must be some kind of attachment between Frank and Harriet. Harriet Woodhouse receives a letter from Emma saying that she is unable to attend Elton because of her ill health. Emma tells Harriet that she would like to see her if she could, and Harriet agrees to go along with the plan. Emma also learns that Frank Churchill has come to visit Hartfield in order to make up for his absence from London. When Emma returns home, she finds Mrs. Dixon having another conversation with Jane Fairfax about how much she admires her. Emma thinks this is an unfortunate turn of events. The Knightleys are due to visit their grandparents soon, and Emma invites them to stay for a day. Emma blushes, then goes back to Jane. She tells Mrs. Westons that she has gone to the Post Office and is going to have to wait an extra day for her letters. When Frank Churchill arrives, he gives Emma a letter from Frank saying that he will visit Highbury with them next week. They move their house closer to Enscombe so they can take advantage of the warmer weather. The ball goes off without a hitch. Emma notices Frank Churchill approaching Harriet, who is sitting down at the dinner table. He asks her to dance and she obliges. When they are half way up the dance floor, Frank reveals that he has forgotten to bring his scissors with him when he left them at the Bates house. They begin to form a conversation about friendship and affection between Frank and Harriet. During this conversation, Emma tells Harriet that she does not approve of Frank Churchill because he is so low-class. Harriet explains that she was only interested in him for a short time but then realized that he was superior to her during their courtship. She also mentions that she saw signs of admiration between Jane and Frank on one of their many walks together. The narrator concludes Chapter I by stating that all things considered must be put on hold until next fall. The party decides to go to London and stay the night at Box Hill, where Jane Fairfax is staying. They walk there for a while, and when Jane passes by Emma, she tells her that it is time to leave. When Frank Churchill arrives, he apologizes for his rudeness and says that he will tell Jane what she thinks of him later. He also suggests that they all take a carriage ride home together so that they can have some alone time together on the way back from London. Emma goes to visit Jane Fairfax on the way home. She finds that Jane has decided to accept her new position, but that she does not yet know whether it will be a good one or a bad one. Emma also meets Frank Churchill at his lodgings. He tells Emma that he and Jane have been secretly engaged for three months. When Emma asks him about this, he says that he is only interested in Jane because she is so well-languishing and needs help getting over her illness. The next day, Mr., Weston receives a letter from Frank saying that Jane is now engaged to another man. This news upsets Emma even more when she realizes that Frank knows who the other man is. Emma reflects on the events of the previous few days and realizes that she has not been entirely successful in wooing Harriet. In fact, she is beginning to suspect that Knightley may be interested in her. Emma writes to Harriet asking her not to visit Hartfield because she does not want to jeopardize Harriet's happiness. When Harriet comes home, Emma tells her how sorry she is for having made such a mistake. She also tells Harriet how much she adored Frank Churchill during their time together at Box Hill. Emma says that she cannot imagine why Harriet would think herself so highly attached to Frank Churchill when she had no reason to attach herself to him after all Mrs. Weston writes Emma a letter explaining the engagement and giving her opinion of Jane Fairfax. She also explains that she was late to the meeting, but did not want to delay it too long. When asked about it later, Frank Churchill tells Emma that he does not approve of the match because Mr. Dixon had encouraged Jane Fairfax to wait until after Mrs. Martin had died before accepting the match. Emma is relieved that Harriet will not have to endure another year of lonely living in London. advertisement",4.775671223360113,0.307086609
In His Image," On a trip to Turin to analyse the Shroud of Turin, journalist Decker Hawthorne and Professor Harry Goodman discover human dermal cells remaining. After the trip, Goodman takes some samples back to his laboratory, in the United States, and discovers that they are still alive. He then invites Decker to show him his discoveries. Once Decker arrives, Goodman explains several of his theories about the cells, and has engineered a strain of ""C Cells"" which are incredibly resiliant to damage and disease. Goodman is actively searching for ways these C Cells could be implemented to insert into ones body to cure disease, due to their strange properties and signs of immortality. Then the professor proposes to Decker the idea of cloning the cells, but Decker does not support this idea. Some years pass and Decker visits professor Goodman with one of his two daughters. While Hawthorne and Goodman talk for some time, Decker's daughter meets and interacts with the Goodman's adopted son, Christopher. On the way back home, Decker deduces Christopher's origin. He immediately returns to Goodman's home and confronts him about Christopher being the Clone of Jesus Christ. Goodman explains that Christopther is like any usual boy, but that he shows a high degree of intelligence and has never suffered from disease of any kind. He convinces Decker not to do a story or Christopher's life will be ruined. Before leaving, Decker assumes out loud that Goodman named the child ""Christopher"" because of Jesus Christ, of whom he was cloned; but the professor rapidly corrects him, claiming that he named him in name of Christopher Colombus, since he believed that the child would usher the world into a new era. Several years later, Decker visits Israel on business and stays with old friends, Joshua and Ilyana Rosen. There he learns lots of things about the historical place and its notable culture. During his visit, Decker receives an anonymous phone call saying that ""Dogs will cry, but their tears will find no place to land"" following the shootings of several Palestinians by Israeli troops in a riot. He immediately calls the police and they tell him that the call must have come from Muslim terrorists, making a threat of some kind of massacre or attack against the Jews (to which the callers referred to as ""the dogs""), but they remain uncertain about where they plan to attack. Decker realizes that the terrorists who called him were referring to The Wailing Wall when they said that the Jews tears would have ""no place to land"". He rushes to the historical site, just in time to watch it blow up entirely. He saves a young boy from being killed by the blast. In retaliation for the destruction of The Western Wall, Israel destroys the Dome of the Rock and retake the Temple Mount. Decker later goes to check on the boy, but he is kidnapped by terrorists, along with his companion journalist and long time friend and confidant, Tom Donafin. They are held captive in an unknown building in Lebanon. He and Tom remain imprisoned for three years. Decker and Tome escape, after one day Decker had a dream of Christopher Goodman, who leads him to the exit. In the dream his captors are dispatched and lie throughout the building. Decker reminds the Dream Christopher that Tom was also held prisoner, and Christopher absent-mindedly shows Decker where he is. Upon waking Decker discovers that his door is unlocked and his captures were dispatched in the same fashion as in his dream, and Tom was right where Christopher had shown him. Decker and Tom then make their escape into the countryside where they are rescued by United Nations troops under none other than the Secretary General, Jon Hansen, with whom Decker forms an instant friendship and bond. They are housed temporarily in Israel, which is under attack by Russians, until it is safe for them to fly home. Transport is arranged for them to get out of the besieged city, however a dog-fight in progress causes Tom and Decker to exit the car to document the duel and Tom tries to get pictures. The car, the driver and Tom are hit by a blast from one of the fighter planes. Decker survives, and Tom is assumed dead. It is revealed the Tom, however does not die. He is stricken blind, however, from the explosion and from flying glass. Decker is informed that Tom's body was never found and he is presumed dead. Decker is finally reunited with his family, and they return to the United States while Decker recovers from captivity. During his recovery period, there is a worldwide catastrophe that seemingly has no explanation. Millions of people wake up next to dead loved ones, and often whole families have died. This event is called ""The Disaster"" by most people, however sudden converts to Christianity begin to call it The Rapture. Decker's entire family, along with his friends abroad, The Rosens, perish in the tragedy. Some collateral damage was also suffered, as people driving cars suddenly die and continue out of control, as well as some commercial airline pilots and others. Decker buries his family, and then falls into a catatonic stupor as the weight of his loss consumes him. Later Christopher Goodman arrives at Decker's house explaining that his adoptive parents died in a plane crash piloted by a casualty of the Disaster. Decker shakes off his catatonia and invites Christopher to stay with him, and Christopher becomes his new family. Jon Hansen offers Decker a position as his assistant at the United Nations, where Christopher encounters Robert Milner, a retired Secretary General who is heavily involved in occult practices, and recognizes Christopher as one who has been prophesied in New Age Councils to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity and enhanced consciousness for mankind. Alice Bernley (a thinly veiled reference to Alice Bailey - an actual noted Theosophist), a confidant of Milner's also sees and recognizes Christopher and they befriend him, and Milner assumes the role of Mentor to Christopher, not only in politics, but in a worldwide New Age movement. Meanwhile, Jon Hansen has been working on an ambitious project to reorganize the United Nations to better handle operations, and in light of the recent Disaster (The Rapture), he has almost open reign to do what he sees necessary. The UN is restructured with a central government led by the Secretary General, and ten Regional Divisions which include Oceania and Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, the Americas, etc. Each of these regions is led by a Primary Regent who is backed up by an Alternate who serves as proxy when the Primary is absent. Israel is the only nation on earth that refuses to join the UN. They refuse to join because their regional partners are all Arab nations that will force them into a position that is extremely unfavorable and lacking represenation within the UN. Meanwhile, Christian Fundamentalists, citing various prophecies in the Biblical Book of Revelation, identify Hansen as the Antichrist or ""The Beast"". This, however, quickly ends as Jon Hansen tragically dies when his helicopter crashes in Pakistan during a fact finding mission. The Office of Secretary General falls vacant, and remains vacant. None of the Ten Regents believe there was anyone to be a suitable replacement for the extremely charismatic, popular and altruistic Hansen. A rotation schedule is established where each Primary Regent serves as Acting Secretary General for a month. It is deemed that this cycle will continue until a unanimous agreement can be made for Hansen's replacement. Unanimous consent is proven to be almost impossible. Years pass, and Christopher has been elected as the European Alternate Regent. Under the tutelage of Milner and Bailey Christopher has embraced his spiritual nature, as well as Decker who has provided him with pragmatic and political guidance. Under machinations of Milner and with the cooperation of various groups such as Freemasons and the Knights Templar with the funding from an occult clearinghouse known as The Lucius Trust (a thinly veiled reference to The Lucis Trust), Christopher comes into possession of The Ark of the Covenant. He gives the Ark to Israel as a gift. and in exchange he wants Israel to sign a treaty with the UN. A seven year treaty is signed promising Israel that they will not be impeded by their neighbors, and UN recognizes their right to exist. When it is proven that the Ark is authentic - proven as Alice Bernley dies from looking inside - Israel agrees, joins the United Nations, and The Ark is placed in the New Temple that was built on the Temple Mount (previously retaken by Israel after the destruction of The Wailing Wall). Albert Faure (renamed to Albert Moore in later printings), an extremely aggressive and deft manipulator - as well as the Primary Regent of Europe - sets in motion a plan that he hopes will gain him the position of Secretary General. Meanwhile, Christopher, following a Spirit guide sets off into the desert for guidance after a series of extremely unsettling dreams about God and an impending feeling of global doom. When Christophers journey into the desert nears its completion (after 40 days and 40 nights), Milner leads Decker to the desert where he says they will encounter Christopher who will need their assistance. Christopher's ""vision quest"" has revealed Faure's plan to him, and he intends to stop it. However they learn that Christopher is too late, because Faure's plan has already culminated in several strategic assassinations, as well as the declaration and execution of the China-India-Pakistan war, a nuclear conflict that lasts a single day, yet ends with hundreds of millions of casualties. No clear winner was declared or recognized in this war, however Moore uses incident to catapult himself into a position of power, at which time he forces a vote for Secretary General. He expects unanimous consent due to bribery, force, blackmail and threats against the other Regents, and he is widely expected to win. Just as the vote for Secretary General is under way, Christopher shows up at the United Nations and announces that Faure was responsible for the assassinations and is the single man who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions in the China-India-Pakistan war. Faure denies this, but Christopher insists, and commands Faure to confess. Seemingly under the power of Christopher Goodman, Faure does confess, and then immediately drops dead in front of every one at the United Nations. It is concluded that Faure died under the weight of his own guilt, but Decker and Robert Milner realize that Christopher has extraordinary powers and he was beginning to exercise them.
","The Underground Man tells Jon that he has seen two machines crawl up a hillside. He says they look like metal, but Jon can't stand it any longer. The old man explains that the machines were made by humans long before gamma ray storms hit them in the face and caused them to run away. They are called ""Mechs"" because they have red rays on their irises. When Jon realizes who the mechanicals are , he cries out for help. The men explain that they do not know how to kill organic life until they see him. Jon runs off into the forest where he falls asleep. In the morning, Jon wakes up and finds himself surrounded by what looks like thousands of human-made grubs crawling along the hillside toward him. He remembers seeing two of these grubs: one was smooth, the other was small, and Jon thinks they must be intelligent metal. After some time, however, Jon realizes they are just machines making dirt from molten rock. The narrator notes that this is an important part of the project as it represents the foundation's mission to preserve the intellectual property of the technology.",0.001249303,0.15005358797250745
The Ghost," The greater part of the action is on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, where Lang has been holed up in the holiday home of his billionaire American publisher in order to turn out his memoirs on a deadline. Other scenes are set in Notting Hill, New York and Whitehall. Lang's former press aide Mike McAra has been struggling to ghost his master's memoirs but, as the novel opens, McAra drowns when he apparently falls off the Woods Hole ferry. The fictional narrator of The Ghost, whose name is never revealed, is hired to replace him (his girlfriend walks out on him over his willingness to take the job: ""She felt personally betrayed by him; she used to be a party member.""). He soon suspects foul play and stumbles across evidence of possible motive, buried in Lang's Cambridge past. Having located what may be the lethal secret, the replacement ghostwriter begins to fear for his own safety. Meanwhile Lang, like his real-life counterpart, has been accused by his enemies of war crimes. A leaked memorandum has revealed that he secretly approved the transfer of UK citizens to Guantanamo Bay to face interrogation and possible torture. One Richard Rycart, Lang's disillusioned and renegade former foreign secretary (loosely based on Robin Cook), who before and during his early days in office made much of his wish to adopt an ""ethical"" foreign policy, is now at the UN, in a position to do his former boss serious damage. Unlike Blair, Lang thus appears in imminent threat of indictment at the International Criminal Court. The narrator tussles to reconcile his obligation to complete the ghosting job with its attendant abundant payment on the one hand and, on the other, the pressing need, as he sees it, to reveal Lang's true allegiances. The action really heats up when he contacts Rycart. The narrator comes under increasing jeopardy: romantically and politically, as well as physically.
","The Ghost The Ghost tells the story of a street called ""Beacon Hill"" in Boston during the height of the depression of the seventeenth century. It had been inhabited by several families, including Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Douglass, who both died before they were born. In addition, two houses on the street are occupied by tenants who refuse to pay rent; one is owned by Mr. Burlingame's brother-in-law, while another belongs to an anonymous third party. A ghost appears at the window and beckons Doctor Renton to open the door for her. After he does so, she disappears into the darkness. Her father comes back with a letter addressed to her asking him to help her find a place to stay. When he opens it, he finds that George has died. He left behind a letter explaining his experiences in the world and how he came to be where he is today. His last words are: ""All men for humanity. This is what we should all do. You shall rise above the petty grind of life."" The next morning, after wandering the streets for a while, Renton finally arrives at Miller's. He tells her that Feval has died and that he is now looking for her in the neighborhood. She responds by saying that she does not want to go down there with the goblin on her tail. This makes Renton even more determined to find her. When he does find her, however, he finds out that she has received a letter from Mr. Flannagan asking her to help him pay his rent. The letter also states that it contains information about Mrs. Flint who owns the boardinghouse where Fils-Beau was found murdered. In other words, all of this information means nothing to Renton anymore. advertisement",1.0826248824625306,0.18137254404664085
The Secret Sharer," *Nameless Captain (Narrator) *Leggatt *Captain Archbold (Skipper of the Sephora) *The Second Mate *The Chief Mate *The Steward ---- The story takes place at sea, near the Gulf of Siam, and is told from the perspective of a young nameless Captain. The captain is unfamiliar with both his ship and his crew, having only joined their company a fortnight earlier. The Captain is furthermore unsure of himself, questioning his ability to fulfill the role of such an authoritative figure. These themes are explored through symbols throughout the novella. The captain soon encounters a naked swimmer holding onto the side ladder of the ship while he is alone at night on look-out duty. He helps the mysterious swimmer onto the boat and hides him in his cabin without the rest of the crew's knowledge. He then learns of the mysterious swimmer's past; his name is Leggatt, and he swam away from a nearby ship, called the Sephora, where, as chief mate, he killed another crew member for insolence during a storm. The captain keeps Leggatt hidden in his quarters, away from the suspicious crew members and a visit from the skipper of the Sephora. Eventually the Captain allows Leggatt to escape by bringing the ship perilously close to land for Leggatt to swim away safely, though this risky sailing maneuver nearly sends the ship into the rocks, testing the Captain's seamanship. He succeeds and leads the ship away.
","In this chapter, Conrad describes his voyage to the seashore. He notes that he is now alone on the ship and wonders how far he will turn in faithful to the ideal image of ""one's own personality."" He notices that the crew does not have a watch; instead, they are all working day-to-day. After some time, however, the crew sees a naked man floating near the ladder used by the captain for the post of chief cabin boy. The sight of this lifeless body frightens him greatly. When the first mate comes aboard, he asks to be allowed to use the side ladder as it is built so that the captain can see him without being seen. As the second Mate gets up to leave, the captain tells him that there has been a gale at sea which caused the ship to lose its ability to navigate during the storm. The captain agrees to let the dying man go into his cabin with the help of an old parson who lives nearby. In order to clear the way for the new captain to board, the Captain takes off his shoes and ties his hair back in a bunting around his head. At the beginning of the chapter, the narrator realizes that the sailor had fallen overboard while attempting to row across the Seashore from a boat bound for Australia. The Captain and his Second Mate make their way to the bow of the Leviathan. The first mate asks the captain if he has heard about the mutiny on the English Channel. The Captain replies that he does not know, but a steward informs him that the captain did not dare to give an order for the ship's emergency crew to save the life of a sailor who drowned in the sea while saving the lives of other sailors. After this conversation, the Captain realizes that there is no longer any trust between himself and the Captain. He decides to leave the cabin and go to the main deck. While he is doing so, he sees a white substance floating in the water. It is the Secret Shellr, or ""white hat,"" as the narrator calls it. This object reminds him of his white hat. advertisement",2.768400004088028,0.21369862527663738
The Pirate," Mr Mertoun and his son had arrived as strangers, and resided for several years in the remaining rooms of the old mansion of the Earls of Orkney, the father leading a very secluded life, while the son Mordaunt became a general favourite with the inhabitants, and especially with the udaller, Magnus Troil, and his daughters. On his way home from a visit to them, he and the pedlar Snailsfoot sought shelter from a storm at the Yellowleys' farmhouse, where they were amused with their penurious ways, and encountered Norna, a relative of Magnus Troil who was supposed to be in league with the fairies, and to possess supernatural powers. The next day a ship was wrecked on the rocky coast, and, at the risk of his life, Mordaunt rescued the captain, Cleveland, as he was cast on the beach clinging to a plank, while Norna prevented his sea-chest from being pillaged. Cleveland was in fact a pirate, but they did not know this. The captain promised his preserver a trip in a consort ship which he expected would arrive shortly, and went to seek the udaller's help in recovering some of his other property that had been washed ashore. After the lapse of several weeks, however, during which the Troils had discontinued their friendly communications with him, Mordaunt heard that the stranger was still their guest, and that they were arranging an entertainment for St John's Eve, to which he had not been bidden. As he was brooding over this slight, Norna touched his shoulder, and, assuring him of her goodwill, advised him to join the party uninvited. Warned by his father against falling in love, and with some misgivings as to his reception, he called at Harfra on his way, and accompanied Yellowley and his sister to the feast. Minna and Brenda Troil replied to their discarded companion's greeting with cold civility, and he felt convinced that Captain Cleveland had supplanted him in their esteem. The bard, Claud Halcro, endeavoured to cheer him with his poetry and reminiscences of John Dryden; and, in the course of the evening, Brenda, disguised as a masquer, told him they had heard that he had spoken unkindly of them, but that she did not believe he had done so. She also expressed her fear that the stranger had won Minna's love, and begged Mordaunt to discover all he could respecting him. During an attempt to capture a whale the following day, Cleveland saved Mordaunt from drowning, and, being thus released from his obligation to him, intimated that henceforth they were rivals. The same evening the pedlar brought tidings that a strange ship had arrived at Kirkwall, and Cleveland talked of a trip thither to ascertain whether it was the consort he had been so long expecting. After the sisters had retired to bed, Norna appeared in their room, and narrated a startling tale of her early life, which led Minna to confess her attachment to the captain, and to elicit Brenda's partiality for Mordaunt. At a secret interview the next morning, Cleveland admitted to Minna that he was a pirate, upon which she declared that she could only still love him as a penitent, and not as the hero she had hitherto imagined him to be. He announced, in the presence of her father and sister, his intention of starting at once for Kirkwall; but at night he serenaded her, and then, after hearing a struggle and a groan, she saw the shadow of a figure disappearing with another on his shoulders. Overcome with grief and suspense, she was seized with a fit of melancholy, for the cure of which the udaller consulted Norna in her secluded dwelling; and, after a mystic ceremony, she predicted that the cause would cease when ""crimson foot met crimson hand"" in the Martyr's Aisle in Orkney land, whither she commanded her kinsman to proceed with his daughters. Mordaunt had been stabbed by the pirate, but had been carried away by Norna to Hoy, where she told him she was his mother, and, after curing his wound, conveyed him to Kirkwall. Here Cleveland had joined his companions, and, having been chosen captain of the consort ship, he obtained leave from the provost for her to take in stores at Stromness and quit the islands, on condition that he remained as a hostage for the crew's behaviour. On their way they captured the brig containing the Troils, but Minna and Brenda were sent safely ashore by John Bunce, Cleveland's lieutenant, and escorted by old Halcro to visit a relative. The lovers met in the cathedral of St Magnus, whence, with Norna's aid, Cleveland escaped to his ship, and the sisters were transferred to the residence of the bard's cousin, where their father joined them, and found Mordaunt in charge of a party of dependents for their protection. When all was ready for sailing, the captain resolved to see Minna once more, and having sent a note begging her to meet him at the Standing Stones of Stenness at daybreak, he made his way thither. Brenda persuaded Mordaunt to allow her sister to keep the appointment, and as the lovers were taking their last farewell, they and Brenda were seized by Bunce and his crew from the boat, and would have been carried off, had not Mordaunt hastened to the rescue, and made prisoners of the pirate and his lieutenant. Norna had warned Cleveland against delaying his departure, and his last hopes were quenched when, from the window of the room in which he and Bunce were confined, they witnessed the arrival of the Halcyon, whose captain she had communicated with, and the capture, after a desperate resistance, of their ship. The elder Mertoun now sought Norna's aid to save their son, who, he declared, was not Mordaunt, as she imagined, but Cleveland, whom he had trained as a pirate under his own real name of Vaughan, her former lover; and having lost trace of him till now, had come to Jarlshof, with his child by a Spanish wife, to atone for the misdeeds of his youth. On inquiry it appeared that Cleveland and Bunce had earned their pardon by acts of mercy in their piratical career, and were allowed to enter the king's service. Minna was further consoled by a penitent letter from her lover; Brenda became Mordaunt's wife; and the aberration of mind, occasioned by remorse at having caused her father's death, having died, Norna abandoned her supernatural pretensions and peculiar habits, and resumed her family name.
","The Circassian The following chapter describes the voyage of the Circassian from 1836 to 1855. The narrator notes that although the ship is small, it has a crew of hardy seamen who are able to keep the ship afloat despite its rough condition. On their way to New York in June, they come across the wrecked Circassian and are rescued by Captain Ingram with the help of two other sailors, Mr. Bareth and his son-in-law, Jonathan Trapps. They learn that Lady Mary had died while attempting to pay her bill. She left behind a litter of black children for them to care for Witherington wakes up to find that the Templemore children have been rescued from the wrecked Circassian. He immediately sends for Jonathan and Mary, but they refuse to let him go because he is afraid of cannibalism. A letter arrives from Captain Stewart of the Eurydicine detailing the situation with regard to the birth of the children. The letter also describes the rescue efforts being undertaken by William Morris, a black servant who has obtained information from Jonathan's mother regarding the whereabouts of their sister-in-law. After three months of no news, WitherINGTON writes to Bath in order to inform his sister of the impending arrival of her baby. On August 31st, an anonymous letter arrives saying that it has been safely delivered to Portsmouth by Captain Stewart. It also states that William Morris plans to hire two black servants to escort the children to their rooms so that they can be reunited with their parents. Upon hearing about the imminent arrival of Little Father Time, Mr. Witherton decides to write again to Bath requesting confirmation of the story. When he receives the reply, he promptly writes back telling his sister what has transpired. Shortly thereafter, on August 30th, after several months of silence, Edward discovers that his sister has informed him of the events which have taken place. During this time, all arrangements are made to take advantage of the newly formed friendship between William Morris and Lady Betty. In Chapter Nineteen, the action shifts to the midshipman , the pirate ship, the Unicorn. Its crew consists of sixteen sailors, eighteen males, eighteen females, and one blind seamen. Their leader, Captain Cain, is described as ""cain,"" a six-foot-tall, 160-pound man . . . stout, well-built, handsome, and dignified."" His name is Cain. The pirate-ship continues its pursuit, and soon the crew discovers that Francisco has escaped. They try to capture him in the hopes of finding some treasure, but all they can find is a small wooden boat with only one mast on it. Just as the boat gets closer to shore, however, the ship strikes a large wave and capsizes. Francisco tries to escape by hiding in the boat's cabin, but when he tries to do so, his life is in danger. The narrator gives us a brief account of what happens after Francisco escapes. He tells the story of how he came to be separated from his fellowcreatures during the mutiny of several months ago. In those days, there were plenty of free people living off the land because of the laws of the trade: pirates, sailors, and natives; not just the wealthy ones who work for the tanning companies. San Francisco inspects the aftermath of the storm. He finds that twelve of the sixty-two surviving slaves have regrown and are now able to return to their homes. The other nine have not. Francisco uses force to bring them food, water, and shelter. They all eat and sleep for four days. During this time, he notices that the ship has sunk in the Atlantic Ocean. A wave sweeps the shoreline away from them as they try to make it back to civilization. On reaching land, San Francisco sees a burning ship with its crew on board: the Revenge of the Avenger. This ship is believed to be the Spanish ship Fortune, owned by Don Pedro's brother-in-law. After watching the wreck for several days, Francisco realizes that there must be at least one person missing who could potentially be among the missing. He decides to go ashore and find out what happened to those aboard the ship. Upon arriving at the landing site, he discovers that the Revenge has been captured by pirates. He immediately volunteers to search for the pirate ship but refuses to do so until he meets up with his old pal, Edward Templmore. Cain realizes that his affection for Francisco is beginning to fade. He wonders if it will lead him to repent and good works again, or if he will have to face the consequences of his actions. Cain reluctantly agrees to go for Francisco in order to ""reunite"" their old friendship. The ship's second mate reports that a pirate vessel has arrived on the island of Hispaniola. They try to catch the pirate ship but are unsuccessful. When they finally catch up with the pirates' ship, they find out who the pirate is--Hawkhurst! It turns out that this pirate ship is the Revenge of the Virgin Mary, owned by Henry Ford. This freaks both the pirate captain and Henry Ford out so they can get back into business as usual. Meanwhile, the Confederates have captured Captain Hawkerurst from the wreck of the Evo-Souvenger. In an effort to salvage some money for the ransom paid to Henry Ford, the crew decides to put together a rescue party: the Comus, theEnterprise, and Missionaries. Hawkhurst saves Francisco by choking him and then freeing him of his bonds. The trial continues, with Hawkhurd claiming that he killed Captain Donnithorne but asserting that he did it for the sake of Clara. When the jury returns their verdict, they find Francisco innocent of all charges including murder, kidnapping, torture, and co-conspirator in crime. He maintains that he is alive because of the help of a kind Spanish pirate captain named Francis who was present aboard the ship at the time of the attack on the Avenger. A few weeks later, Cain reappears on the scene to defend himself against the charge of pirate-murder. He tells the story of how he saved the lives of several crewmen while traveling between the Galapagos and the Turks. His testimony convinces the jury that he will indeed be exonerated. Just as the jury begins deliberating, the specter of Cain appears. It is revealed that the pirate captain had hidden a Bible under the cabin of the ship during its voyage to Africa. This discovery greatly improves the fortunes of those involved in the pirate business. advertisement",1.8758979752698435,0.1694581230828995
The Golden Road," The plot is based around the character Beverley who remembers his childhood days with his brother Felix and friends and cousins Felicity, Cecily, Dan, Sara Stanley (the ""Story Girl""), hired-boy Peter and neighbor Sara Ray. The children often played in their family's orchard and had many adventures, even creating their own newspaper, called Our Magazine. More character development takes place in this novel than in its predecessor, and the reader is able to watch the children grow up; in particular, they are able to watch Sara Stanley leave the Golden Road of childhood forever. They also are able to see the beginnings of a relationship between Peter and Felicity, as chemistry between them starts to build; it also seems that Beverly and Sara Stanley are drawn to each other, but this is left undeveloped. Throughout the story it is hinted that Beverly's cousin, Cecily, is consumptive; in a passage where the Story Girl tells their futures, the adult Beverly confirms that Cecily never left the Golden Road. As well, she strongly hints that Peter and Felicity will be married. The novel ends after Sara's father collects her to give her a proper education, and their small group is never complete again.
","The Golden Road The narrator tells us that he and his daughter-in-law have decided to start a newspaper. They think of the name ""The Daily Herald"" , but they decide it is more appropriate for the Town of Carlyle where all the young people live, since there are so few people in the town who can write their own newspaper. In order to do this, they plan to create a newspaper called The Story Boy's Daily Enterprise . Everyone agrees on the idea except for Peter, who has no experience of editing newspapers. After some brainstorming, they decide to make a newspaper with stories instead of just one story each. Then they decide what department they will use as an editor. It starts off with a game of blind-man's buff. But then they figure out how to put together a newspaper from scratch. And guess what? There are lots of really interesting things going on at the beginning of chapter three. First up is a Christmas Eve party hosted by Aunt Janet. All the kids get along very well, although Felicity gets a little tiff with her stepmother because she keeps trying to tell her father about Kenneth Macnair. She also tries to convince everyone else not to let her know about him. When Uncle Roger comes home after the party, he makes fun of Felicity for being such a vain girl. He even gives her a present: a red silk gown. This dress reminds Felicity of her favorite childhood dress, which she wore when she went riding with Kenneth back in high school. As the story continues, we find out that Mr. Barlow had beaten Father #1 in a local election many years before. That same year, Father #2 beat Father #3 in a nearby mayoral election. So now Mother #1 doesn't care if Father # 1 wins or Margaret #2 loses. The Story Girl makes four resolutions for the New Year: 1) to always be cheerful; 2) not to talk mean gossip; 3) to never say what everyone else thinks, but to always think of things in terms of how they are going to live. The narrator tells us that his resolution is to think about beautiful thoughts before breakfast every morning. He also says that he will stop being so judgmental when someone else says nice things to him. Felix asks if he can have a glass of wine at breakfast each morning. They all make their resolutions without commenting on anything other than what they see or hear. The story continues as it does throughout the novel. In March, Dan King receives a letter from his Aunt Martha asking him to forgive her and invite her over for dinner. She wants to thank him for having such a wonderful time with her family. On the way home, Grandma Eliza comes up the road. It turns out she has been visiting some relatives in town. Her husband died while she was there, and now she lives with them. When she gets home, she leaves a note saying that she plans to visit again soon. The Story Girl and Dan tell the story of their trip to Aunt Olivia's house. They all agree that it is a bad idea to go there, especially since Aunt Olivia will be getting married soon. The narrator notes that they have not yet had a good meal at PegBowens house, so they decide to head over to her home instead. When they arrive, they find out that she has run away with her father, who died in a freak accident while traveling through the snow one day. She also tells them about Mr. Jarndyce, whom she calls ""the monster"" for short. Meanwhile, Celia refuses to eat porridge because it is too icky; Felicity does not want to eat anything but ginger tea; and Cecily complains about being sun-burned from standing on top of a tree during a storm. Lastly, we learn that Paddy has mysteriously disappeared. Chapters XI and XII The Witch's Wishbone After a fortnight of searching, the story girls finally discover that Paddy is dead. They go to visit him in his woods home where he lives with his Story Girl and her pet cat, who has been missing for nine months. He tells them that he lost his cat when he tried to retrieve it from its hiding place. When they get there, however, they see that no wishbone exists, so they have to rely on the help of Aunt Jemima, whom they now call ""the Story Girl."" Meanwhile, Celia complains about her lack of attention to detail at school. She also complains about the fact that she cannot attend church because she wants to be more like Aunt Marta. Then one day, Peter asks Felicity if she knows who Caius Brisk is--and Felicity says yes. It turns out that Mr. Passepartout, Uncle Roger, had converted some members of his family into Methodists back in England. This upsets Felicity but makes her happy. In Chapter XIV, we find out that Aunt Jessepercy has married an old Halifax man named Robert Seton. The Story Girl learns from Peter that his Aunt Olivia has died and left behind a legacy. They go to visit her at the school, where they find Sara Ray sitting on a bench surrounded by ivy with a man who looks like him. The story girl tells them that she is afraid of being bitten by the bejeebies while walking in the park one day. When they get home, they discover that Sara Ray has been strung by wasps. She explains that she hid the bellailles in the pocket of her dress so as not to attract attention. She also says that she does not want to see Aunt Olivia again because she thinks it would be scandalous for her to have such a life-threatening illness. Meanwhile, everyone else is busy preparing for their upcoming school concert. Everyone seems nervous about attending the concert since there are no rehearsals scheduled for the following day. However, when they finally arrive back at the King house, they learn that Mr. Martin Marwood has arranged for Sara Ray to attend the concert along with her family. The Story Girls and Dan have a fistfight last Tuesday. They also fight over who gets to pick the brains of the cow that kicked them. Meanwhile, Felicity has a fight with Captain Donnithorne. The story girl says she will never learn anything new from him. Then there is a scene involving Peg Bowen, an old maid at Carlisle High School named Mrs. Conklin. She gives birth to a litter of pigeons in order to make it easier for her to get pregnant. After this scene ends, the Story Girls tell everyone else about how they are going to help poor little kids in Korea by dressing up as their favorite pew-maids. Everyone laughs until one of them runs away crying. A few days later, Celia tells Felicity that she wants to go out walking with her so she can tell people what happened on the North Shore. It turns out Mr. Dixon ordered all the children to dress up like Little Em'lyttes instead of Minnie Clydesdales , which would be super duper hard to do since no one ever notices you wearing your costume. The narrator and his co-workers discuss the upcoming wedding. The narrator notes that some of the characters seem to be preoccupied with their impending nuptials. For example, there is an unnamed young man named Jasper Dale who lives in a cabin near Golden Milestones. He has never attended church or had a family home before. There are also hints that he may have married someone else. Meanwhile, Alice receives a letter from her mother asking her to marry her someday. In September, the narrator visits Aunt Janet and Uncle Blair on Uncle Stephen's Walk. They find a beautiful picture of Alice sitting beneath a pine tree surrounded by blooming flowers. She tells them that she loves them very much and asks them to remember her name when she dies. When they return home, they find out that Uncle Blair has taken custody of Alice. Uncle Blair and Aunt Janet are fifteen and a half years old when they go exploring together. They decide to stop by Uncle Roger's orchard one more time so they can have a little chat before they head off on their trip back to Canada. On the way, they come across a dying fir tree that reminds them of childhood memories. Unsurprisingly, Uncle Blair starts singing along with them as they talk about how wonderful it is to be surrounded by nature. The story girl says she wants to know where her future might lie, but Uncle Blair tells her not to worry--it will all be okay. When they finally arrive at the spot where Uncle Roger has been waiting for them, they find out that he has just died of poison. It turns out that Uncle Roger had planned to send his son to college in order to get some work done. But since Uncle Roger isn't around anymore, he plans to move to another part of the country instead. Meanwhile, Sara Ray dies too. She writes a letter to her family telling them that she wishes they would let her live longer because she doesn't want anyone else to think that she went there. In other words, if you're wondering what kind of person lives in this world, here's your answer. advertisement",0.5420219293341942,0.16427639871491737
The Hill of Dreams," The novel recounts the life of a young man, Lucian Taylor, focusing on his dreamy childhood in rural Wales, in a town based on Caerleon. The Hill of Dreams of the title is an old Roman fort where Lucian has strange sensual visions, including ones of the town in the time of Roman Britain. Later it describes Lucian's attempts to make a living as an author in London, enduring poverty and suffering in the pursuit of art.
","Lucian walks to the top of a steep hill and watches the sunrise from a high vantage point. He is amazed at how quickly the sun begins to rise, reflecting on the beauty of the natural world around him. On his way home, he passes an old abandoned road that promises adventure and adventure; instead, it leads him to a dilapidated country estate called the Hill Of Dreams. The narrator notes that Lucian's travels have brought him into contact with people who are not familiar with English history or European culture. One such person is Annie Morgan . Lucian meets her when he arrives in London. She is studying at the same boarding school where he has spent most of his childhood. As soon as he gets there, however, he finds himself alone again. His father tells him that Mrs. Taylor will soon be coming to visit them. When Lucian reaches the Heights, he sees Mr. Burrow waiting for him outside the house. Excited by the prospect of meeting someone new, Luciano hurries off to seek medical attention. Lucian begins to write again, this time focusing on a book called A Bad Unto Beat. This book is so good that he decides to copy it and send it to the publishers in London. The publisher refuses to accept the book, but Lucian does manage to get a review from one of his critics. He also receives a letter from his father saying that they cannot print the book due to a family member having a cold. When Lucian rereads the reviews, he realizes how much better the book is than the original manuscript which he has already written. After reading the reviews for several months, he finally agrees to publish the book under the patronage of the lord bishop of the diocese. As soon as he finishes writing the book , Lucian finds himself walking down a hillside. He stops at a roadside crossroads and listens to the sounds of the nearby townspeople. It seems like these are some of the very best people Lucian has ever met. Lucian has romanticized a woman for the past few years. He longs to have a wife and children, but knows that he cannot marry her because she would make him want to kill himself. When his aunt Agatha refuses to allow him to have sex with her, he becomes infatuated with her even more. As time goes on, however, all Lucian wants to do is get away from the West End. He begins to notice signs of rustic behavior in the townspeople, especially when they see him working on his manuscript. One day, while walking home, an old gypsy boy tells Lucian that someone has lost his dog. This makes Lucian realize that he really does have a right to be upset about something. Lucian wanders around the countryside, admiring the sights and sounds of nature. He listens to a local clergyman discussing the alleged wrongs committed by Monsieur Martin, an antiquarian clergyman who has been removed from office for his involvement in church building activities. As time passes, he becomes more and more interested in the wonders of the natural world. He begins to appreciate the finer things in life, especially the beauty and diversity of colors and textures. When Annie Morgan marries a rich young farmer named Henry Dixon , Lucian is filled with glee at the sight of such beautiful women. Lucian begins to write again, this time focusing on novels rather than his life in London. He has no idea what he is doing or where he is going; he just wants to finish a story and have some fun with it. As winter approaches, Lucian finds himself drifting off to another part of town. He wanders aimlessly through the cold and foggy streets of London during the winter months. He tries to memorize lines from classic literature but can't muster up the energy to do so. Finally, he realizes that he cannot be human because he does not appreciate the finer things in life as he would like to be if he were human. This makes him even more miserable. One day, while walking home, he sees a woman staring at him from beneath a lamppost. It turns out she's been robbed by a man who happened to pass by on his way home from work one day. She runs away before Lucian can catch her. Lucian wanders through the streets of London, unable to find any semblance of normality in his surroundings. He longs for a peaceful life full of activity and quiet reflection. When he comes upon a girl running along the street one day, he realizes that she is not the child he had expected her to be. This realization saddens Lucian so much that he decides to leave London and seek refuge in a nearby valley. One Saturday night while walking home, he witnesses an orgy taking place on the high street. A group of impromptu bachelors dances around him; they are joined by several young people who have come to witness the revelry. The scene reminds Lucian of his childhood when he dreamed of ""adulterous mystery"" and how it seemed impossible to reach out to anyone but himself. Afterward, he dreams about all the wonderful things he has learned from this experience. As the storm drags on, Victor imagines that he will never again be able to write. He imagines himself wandering through London in a daze, unable to stop and think of his old life there. The only thing that excites him are the memories of his childhood friend Annie Burrows whom he adored as a little girl. In fact, one day when he is walking home from work, he spots a dilapidated house with an ugly red-roofed door. Inside, he sees Mrs. Bulbonne, who has been waiting for him at the roadside for some time now. She tells him that she wishes he would marry her so that they could have children together. When he realizes that this is not going to happen, however, he decides to go back to writing. advertisement",0.2812906938887664,0.090909089
The Golden Age," The author's first novel, it revolves around the protagonist Phaethon (full name Phaethon Prime Rhadamanth Humodified (augment) Uncomposed, Indepconciousness, Base Neuroformed, Silver-Gray Manorial Schola, Era 7043). The novel concerns Phaethon's discovery that parts of his past have been edited out of his mind—apparently by himself.
","In this chapter, the narrator explains that the Golden Age is a holiday. The narrator and his co-workers are on their way to see King George III at Windsor Castle when they come upon a large grizzly in the distance. They stop for a bite to eat before going on to another part of the estate. In order to avoid being eaten by the grizzly, Harold accidentally drops some pebbles from a nearby stream into which he has been swimming during the day. This causes the narrator to question whether or not he is actually an animal. He does not want to answer that question because it will be too hard for him to do so. As they drive through the countryside, they run into old Uncle Thomas, whom they call ""the Keeper's Boy"" because he is such a good rascal. When they get to the castle, they find out that there is a battle raging between the English and French forces. It is decided that they will christen one of those battles as Roundheads . Charlotte tells the story of how a flamingo steals Rosa's head during a game of croquet. The flamingo runs away, but Charlotte grabs Jerry and tries to get him to tell her his story. When he doesn't, she smacks him on the back for good measure. After that, they have no more time to talk about love. Sunday morning rolls around and everyone is busy preparing for church service. It seems as though the whole town has been swept up in a deluge of snowflakes. They go over to Aunt Maria Larkin , who lives with her husband, Harold, and their dog, Dinah. In the meantime, Falstaff gets into a fight with a local clergyman named Mr. Ransom. He also happens to run into an old schoolboy named Harold at the end of the rope ladder. We learn that this young man wants a Newfoundland puppy so he can take care of his parents. Harold and Edward are preparing ginger beer for the feast they are to have at the Smedleys on the following day. They start talking about how strange it is that strangers can come into their circle of friends without actually knowing what they are talking about; Selina has a knack for spotting cork floating in the water, but she cannot figure out how it gets there. She also tells them that some other boy from her village has joined them as well. The group decides to go downriver to find the hidden room where the mysterious old bureau used to be. There, they find three foreign stamps indicating that they will meet again one day. Then they head back upriver to look for the secret room with its locked door. As they do so, they run into an old man who says he lives in Rome . He asks if they would like to visit there someday. We learn that this man calls himself ""The Knight-Rise,"" after which we learn that his name is Robert Larkin. advertisement",0.2797694067647803,0.079027353
The Phoenix and the Carpet," This middle volume of the trilogy that began with Five Children and It and concludes with The Story of the Amulet deviates somewhat from the other two because the Psammead gets only a brief mention, and because in this volume the children live with both of their parents and their younger brother—the Lamb—in their home in London. Consequently, there is less loneliness and sense of loss in this volume than in the other two. In both of the other volumes, circumstances have forced the children to spend a protracted period away from their familiar London home and their father; in Amulet, their mother and the Lamb are absent as well. A continuing theme throughout The Phoenix and the Carpet is, appropriately enough, the ancient element of fire. The story begins shortly before November 5, celebrated in England as Guy Fawkes Night. Traditionally, children light bonfires and set off fireworks on this night. The four children have accumulated a small hoard of fireworks but are too impatient to wait until November 5 to light them, so they set off a few samples in the nursery. This results in a fire that destroys the carpet. Their parents purchase a second-hand carpet which, upon arrival, is found to contain an egg that emits a weird phosphorescent glow. The children accidentally knock this egg into the fire: it hatches, revealing a golden Phoenix who speaks perfect English. It develops that this is a magical carpet, which can transport the children to anywhere they wish in the present time, although it is only capable of three wishes per day. Accompanied by the Phoenix, the children have exotic adventures in various climes. There is one moment of terror for the children when their youngest brother, the Lamb, crawls onto the carpet, babbles some incoherent baby talk, and vanishes. Fortunately, the Lamb only desired to be with his mother. At a few points in the novel, the children find themselves in predicaments from which the Phoenix is unable to rescue them by himself; he goes to find the Psammead and has a wish granted for the children's sake. In addition, in the end, the carpet is sent to ask the Psammead to grant the Phoenix's wish. These offstage incidents are the only contribution made by the Psammead to this story. The Phoenix and the Carpet features some intriguing depictions of London during the reign of Edward VII. At one point, the children and their supernatural bird visit the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company: the egotistical Phoenix assumes that this is his modern-day temple, and the insurance executives must be his acolytes. The children also have an encounter with two older ruffians named Herb and Ike who attempt to steal the Phoenix. Possibly the most interesting chapter in this novel occurs when the four children attend a Christmas pantomime at a West End theatre, smuggling the Phoenix along inside Robert's coat. The Phoenix is so excited by this spectacle that he unintentionally sets fire to the theatre. In Edwardian times, many theatres in Britain and the United States were fire-traps, and it was not unusual for a conflagration in a theatre to produce hundreds of deaths. This chapter is vivid and highly convincing, but all ends well when the Phoenix magically reverses the damage: no one is harmed, and the theatre remains intact. One aspect of The Phoenix and the Carpet that is atypical for children's fantasy fiction is the fact that, in this story, the magical companion does not treat all the children equally. The Phoenix insists on favouring Robert- the child who actually put his egg in the fire, albeit by accident- over his brother Cyril and their sisters. This is a mixed privilege, as Robert is lumbered with the duty of smuggling the Phoenix past their parents at inconvenient moments. In the novel's final chapter, the Phoenix announces that he has reached the end of his current lifespan and must begin the cycle again (apparently on the grounds that life with the children has left him far more exhausted than he would have been in the wilderness.) He lays a new egg from which he will eventually be reborn. Under the Phoenix's direction, the children prepare an altar with sweet incense, upon which the Phoenix immolates himself. The magical carpet has also reached the end of its lifespan, as it was never intended to be walked upon regularly, and, at the request the Phoenix, it takes the egg away to a place where it won't hatch again for 2,000 years. There is a happy ending, with the children receiving a parcel of gifts from an ""unknown benefactor"" (the Phoenix, who arranges this gift by means of a wish granted by the Psammead), and Robert receiving a single golden feather. But the feather has vanished by the evening and it is truly the last of the Phoenix and the Carpet. The last volume in the series, The Story of the Amulet, contains a minor episode in which the children travel thousands of years into the past and encounter the Phoenix, who does not recognise them because, in his linear timeline, the events of the previous book have not happened yet.
","The Phoenix and The Carpet The chapter opens with the arrival of the fifth of November 1904, the anniversary of the Fawkes holiday. The family is disappointed by the lack of fireworks for which they had planned, but Anthea convinces Robert and Jane that they should instead buy a fire-work set made from Jack in the Box rather than from expensive candles. They decide to have the set as a Christmas present because it will brighten up the nursery where all the children are spending their childhoods. However, this plan does not work out very well. First, the family purchases a carpet from the local furniture shop. Next, they purchase a carpeted carpet from Anthea's home improvement parlor. This carpet has holes in it so that there is no visible light inside. Then, they buy an eggshell from the carpet shop owner who tells them that the eggs are shaped like ""Eggs"" . Finally, they go off to visit some friends at Granny Pines. The Phoenix arrives and takes them to the underground tunnel. They find seventeen passages branching off four ways. At the bottom is a low arch with a stone pebble-shaped hole in it. Inside are hidden gold coins, brown paper bags, dried fruit, and other items. When they get to the bottom there is a dark arch that leads out to what Anthea calls ""fire-damped"" . The Phoenix says he can help by removing the top stones from the pile of them. He then shows Jane a bag containing marbles. She asks him to fetch the bag because she wants to scratch her name on the rocks. After some more searching, Anthea tells her mother that she has had a dream about an alien race called the Whooping Cough. This makes Anthea very happy. On Tuesday night, when Anthea goes to bed, she hears a strange knocking at the door. A tall man comes into the house saying that his wife has sneaked away. It turns out to be Anthea's cook who has come to take care of Anthea while she is doing her cooking. Because Anthea does not want to upset her mother, she decides to go look for the cook herself. While she is looking around, she sees the Lamb behaving strangely towards her The children go to a bazaar and buy Indian items for their mother. They are disappointed to find that they do not have the luxury of having their mother there, but she does send them on as planned. The Biddle family purchases some carpet from Anthea at the flea market in order to make an impression on Mrs. Biddle who is very angry with them for selling such things without her knowledge. She also tells them that if they sell the carpet it will be made into a kind of 'heroic' or daring-and-dashing type of event. When Anthea tries to explain this to Robert, Cyril explains that he has come to get the carpet because his mother wants him to soothe her. He then goes on to tell about how all the beautiful things were sold at the Flea Market; however, when Anthea asks why anyone would want carpets instead of carpet after Easter, Mr. Blank replies that everyone should ask for the carpet before Easter. Jane says that she did not want to give away the carpet since it was built by Mrs. Burlingame. As the children walk home, they hear screams and commotion coming from the street below. A group of people comes to pick them up and take them to the Phoebe's Flower House, which serves as Antheas main residence. At the phoebe shop, one of those people is a porter named Mr. Borchardy. Everyone talks about how wonderful everything is until someone shows up and takes them inside. The Phoenix decides to write a good wish, in which they pretend that the Christmas party will take place at their aunt and uncle's home. The kids are excited about this because they get a letter from their Aunt saying that they will be going to visit her on Christmas Eve. They also get an invitation from Jane to come along with them so they can see what kind of action they want to take. As breakfast is over, Cyril draws out his box of match-and-candle candles and lights a candle. He tells the children that they have two ends: 1) they can do good deeds where they live or 2) they might go into the forest and steal some money for charity. This makes Anthea very happy. She says she would like to sell the castle to someone who has never had the lands before. After breakfast, the boys and girls find themselves inside a small white house full of flowers, gingerbread, cinders, old newspaper, and other odd objects. It seems as though Anthea has forgotten to bring any of these items back to her native country. When they return home, they find all of the things they brought were gone. Then they hear a strange music coming from another part of town. And guess what? There is a police dog there! The Cats, The COW and the Burglar A policeman arrives to check on the children. He tells them that Anthea has a cat locked up in her room because she is afraid of tigers. She explains that they have fed her cats but that they do not know where their house is. They lock the door so that no one will come in and disturb them. Then there is a loud knocking at the back door. It is Cyril's dog, Phoebe, who comes in with some paper telling Anthea that it is time to put out the cats for the night. When he leaves, Anthea says goodbye to Robert and then goes to sleep. The Burglar returns early the next morning after Mrs. Wigsson had been gone all day. He asks Jane if she would like to walk outside with him. She does not want to go out without him. As soon as he gets home, he finds Anthea sitting by the fire trying to talk to her pet cow about how much fun it is to be around animals. After an hour of talking, he returns with the news that Antheas cats have been stolen. There is a celebration going on among the children when Mr. Brownlow, the local gardener, shows up. The carpet in the Carpet The children gather and throw a feast, but before they can eat it, Jane suffers a terrible accident. She is carried away by a wave of smoke as she tries to get her hands on some wrapping paper that has been left over from the previous night's party. They are reunited with their parents, who have come back from their trip to France. After returning home, Robert tells Anthea that he will not be able to go back to school because his studies are too strict. He also says that he does not want any more London society. As soon as the children return home, they find themselves surrounded by a carpet full of broken pieces of furniture. They try to help each other out, but eventually they fall into a trapdoor which leads them to a dilapidated house called ""705, AMERSHAM ROAD"" . It turns out to be an abandoned orphanage owned by Mr. Sedgwick, whose wife died while caring for the children there. Mrs. Seddwick dies shortly afterwards. advertisement",1.993510060483254,0.23076922582860793
The Woodlanders," The story takes place in a small woodland village called Little Hintock, and concerns the efforts of an honest woodsman, Giles Winterborne, to marry his childhood sweetheart, Grace Melbury. Although they have been informally betrothed for some time, her father has made financial sacrifices to give his adored only child a superior education and no longer considers Giles good enough for her. When the new doctor &ndash; a well-born and handsome young man named Edred Fitzpiers &ndash; takes an interest in Grace, her father does all he can to make Grace forget Giles, and to encourage what he sees as a brilliant match. Grace has more awe than love for Fitzpiers, but marries him nonetheless. After the honeymoon, the couple take up residence in an unused wing of Melbury's house. Soon, however, Fitzpiers begins an affair with a rich widow named Mrs. Charmond, takes to treating Grace coldly, and finally deserts her one night after he accidentally reveals his true character to his father-in-law. Melbury tries to procure a divorce for his daughter so she can marry Giles after all, but in vain. When Fitzpiers quarrels with Mrs. Charmond and returns to Little Hintock to try to reconcile with his wife, she flees the house and turns to Giles for help. He is still convalescing from a dangerous illness, but nobly allows her to sleep in his hut during stormy weather, whilst he insists on sleeping outside. As a result, he dies. Grace later allows herself to be won back to the at least temporarily repentant Fitzpiers, thus sealing her fate as the wife of an unworthy man. No one is left to mourn Giles except a courageous peasant girl named Marty South, who all along has been the overlooked but perfect mate for him, and who has always loved him.
","The Woodlanders By Thomas Hardy In this chapter, the main character of the novel is introduced. The protagonist begins with a description of the road that leads from Bristol down to the small hamlet called Little Hintsock. He describes the landscape and its inhabitants as though they were alive but not there. A young woman named Mrs. Sands sits at the wheel of a van driven by Mr. Perry, who asks her to help him find the house where he is going to be looking for his daughter. After Percombe leaves, the narrator tells us that Janey South has been working in the shop all day trying to figure out where she might have gotten her hair cut. She explains that she wants to get married so that Winterborne can take care of her when he is ill. At 5:00 p.m., Marty South arrives at Melbury's home. His wife greets her husband and asks him to join her and Grace on a shopping trip. Giles Winterborne arrives at Melbury's. He explains that he has decided to keep Grace in boarding school for as long as possible so that she will not have to endure the indignity of having to deal with her father while he is away. When he sees Grace, he immediately recognizes her as Grace from his earlier conversation with her about gardening and housekeeping. They meet up again on their way home. Grace tells Winterborne that she wants to go riding with him because she thinks it might be a good idea to do so. As they are driving through the woods, Grace notices an old-fashioned carriage driven by Mr. & Mrs. Fitzpurcy. The carriage takes them to the timber merchant who lives nearby. While there, Grace meets up with Mr. and Mrs. Malbury, who introduce themselves as Dr. Dixon and Lady Charmond respectively. During this visit, Grace reveals that she has been visiting the mill where her father died three months ago. She says that she likes the mill because it reminds her of what life was like when she lived there. Grace Melbury visits Winterborne and Grace on their way to the Christmas party. She tells Winterborne that Grace will be coming with them, but Winterborne does not want to interrupt her because he is worried about what she might think of him going there. He also realizes that Grace has a tendency to over-indulge in the company of people who do not seem to care for her very much. The next day Grace goes to visit Gilsons family at Hintocks House. They invite all the members of their family to come along as guests; they are invited by Grace's father, Giles . Winterborne asks Grace if she would mind helping him set up the treehouse, since his daughter Grace needs help getting it up. Grace says that she wants to know more about the house before she decides whether or not she will go. Winterbreeze agrees to let Grace stay overnight so that she can get used to the new place. Giles Winterborne refuses to let Grace marry Giles, thinking that she is too old-fashioned and will not accept his advances. However, when the Melburys discuss their daughter with Giles one morning, they are surprised to see her sitting up late at breakfast. They explain that they bought a horse from Giles earlier in the day. The next day, Grace tells her father that she wants to marry Giles because she likes him so much. She also says that she does not want to be associated with any other man or woman. Later that afternoon, Grace asks her father why he has not yet taken up Grace's offer of marriage. His answer is simple: ""I cannot stand the shame of living my life without honor. This makes no sense to anyone but me. I am ruining Grace for conscience sake. A week later, on a beautiful November day, there is a conversation among the neighbors about the fate of the hickory elm tree near the Melbury house. It seems as if someone has come from somewhere and cut down the trees; it looks as though someone else has done it. As winterborne prepares to go back to work, he sees Grace coming down the lane. He recognizes her immediately and goes after her. Winterborne is sitting alone in his old house, reflecting on the events of the previous week. He has received a letter from Grace informing him that she has lost her place and asking him to renew it. She also says that she will not begrudge Winterborne any money or anything else for the sake of their future marriage. When Winterborne thinks about this, he realizes that there must be some sort of caprice between Grace and Giles . In the meantime, Grace receives a note from Melbury saying that they have agreed to keep Grace as his wife until he can figure out what the heck to do with the money. The following day, Grace goes to visit Fitzpier, who tells her that Grace is ill and needs someone to talk to. They arrange to meet again later that night at Fitzsiers home. This time, however, Grace does not show up; instead, she hides herself outside by pretending to pull onto the windowcrafters while Fitzpaciers drives by. Gates and Grace discuss the possibility of marrying, but it is decided that Grace should not be married until they can work out a way to marry without any further delay. They also discuss Grace's tendency to over-indulge in affection for Fitzsimmons daughter Grace. The narrator suggests that this may be an opportunity for Grace to develop her own romantic relationship with Fitzhugh. In Chapter XXII, Fitzpuriers meets Dr. Winterbourn at his home. He asks him to take Grace away so that she will not be tempted by anyone else. While he is on the road one day, someone appears from behind a tree. It turns out to be Grace, whose mother has recently passed away. She wants to know if there is money in her purse or not. Fitzpaciers agrees to go along with the plan. Giles Winterborne visits Grace and tells her that the marriage has been made up. He also mentions that he plans to buy a practice in Budmouth, not far from where Grace currently lives. Grace refuses to answer his letter because she is afraid of what it will do to her reputation if she does. She goes back to her father's house and finds him there looking out the window admiring the beautiful autumn day. The next morning Grace returns home and sees Fitzpies kissing her. It turns out that this kiss was meant to be for their honeymoon. They are married five days later at St. Giles Mortimer Grange, who lives with them. Mrs. Mellbury arrives just as they are about to get married. She explains that she wants to avoid being associated with any kind of scandalous gossip or scandal which might result in her marrying someone else. She also says that she feels as if she belongs to something other than her own family since she no longer considers herself part of Gils family. Giles Winterborne visits Grace on the honeymoon. He apologizes to her for treating him so rudely, and tells her that they must move away from the house. She accepts his offer of a job as a private surgeon in London. When he returns home, he finds Grace sitting at the wheel of a carriage with a cigarette in her hand. The carriage overturns and she is seriously hurt. In an attempt to calm her down, Fitzpaciers goes to visit her. Afterward, he asks her if she has had a dream about him. She does not want to talk about it, but says that she will think about it later. They continue their conversation until late one evening when Fitzpier arrives home. He takes Grace aside and asks her what happened. She responds by saying that she lost all her houses during the Civil War, including those belonging to Mr. Sands. Then she went back into her old life again. Later, while walking along the meadow, she comes across Fitzpaniers leaning over some trees looking out onto the valley below. His eyes are fixed on Lady Charmond who is sitting beside him holding a blackberry mare. This scene upsets both Fitz-Piers and Grace very much. It also makes them realize how different they are from each other. Grace realizes that she has made a big mistake in marrying Fitzpeniers. She does not realize how much her husband loves her, especially when he tells her that he will never love her again. Grace also realizes that there is a growing jealousy in the Woodland community as a result of all the bad things that have happened to Grace since they got married. One February afternoon, while Melbury is on his way home from work, he meets up with old friend Giles and asks him to help him deal with Grace. He says that he would like to see Winterborne or Charmond but knows that Grace won't be around for long. When Melbury leaves, he hears rumors that someone has come to tell him that Grace has married Winterborne. The rumor spreads rapidly throughout the area, and Melbury resolves to consult Winterborne before making any final decisions. Grace leaves the house at 3.00 in the afternoon and goes to a woodcutting track, where she meets Mrs. Charmond. She tells Grace that she is looking for her father and asks if Winterborne will be home soon. Grace does not know that Winterborne has already gone back to his house. When they are alone together, Grace realizes that it is time for them to part. They walk through the woods until they come across Felice-Charmond, whom they recognize as Grace's old friend from their meeting in London. Then they run into each other on the way there. The pair hug and talk for a while before heading out again. It turns out that Felice had heard about Grace going to stay with Fitzsibs wife but did not want to see Fitzsiphons name because he was afraid of what would become of her. He also hears rumors that Lady Charmond is rumored to have married Fitzsophisticated husbands. In any case, when they arrive back at the Melbury house, they meet Fitzsphares parents who tell them that Grace is ill and cannot make herself go home. Meanwhile, Dr. Dixon returns from London with word that Fitzspiers has been taken care of by some local surgeon. Fitzsimmons family decides to take advantage of this opportunity to get rid of Mr. Damson. Giles Winterborne visits Grace and informs her that his father has written to him requesting a divorce. He also tells her that if she wants to wed him, she must either go to London or stay in the States. She decides to go to see Winterborne on Sunday morning. While there, she meets up with another friend, GilesWinterborne. They have been friends for twenty-five years, and Winterborne is now aware of how much he has changed since they first began hanging out together. The next day, Grace receives a letter from Melbury saying that their marriage is virtually complete. It seems as though Winterborne himself has fallen into disrepute by refusing to allow Grace to marry him. Giles Winterborne receives a letter informing him that the marriage will not take place until after Winterborne has returned from his work in Switzerland. He is dismayed at this news, but decides to wait until Winterborne returns before he makes any final decisions on the matter. Grace receives another letter saying that her father must come home as soon as possible due to the new law. She goes outside to listen to the sounds of the approaching ship and hears someone approaching. She realizes that it is Winterborne who has arrived; she hurries back to the cottage hoping that she will be able to talk to him again. When she does arrive, she finds that he has boarded a steamship bound for Budmouth. The narrator notes that there have been no reports of anyone being injured or killed during the storm. In an attempt to comfort her, Grace leaves the cottage and wanders through the sparsely populated woods until she comes across Winterborne waiting for her return. Grace waits patiently for Giles to return home. When he does, Grace realizes that Winterborne is dying. She rushes to the hut and finds Winterborne lying on his bed with a bloodied upper lip. The doctor tells her that there is a severe case of typhoid in the area. He suggests that they keep Winterborne in One Chimney Hut until someone else can take care of him. They do manage to stay in one hut for a short time, but then winterborne passes away. Grace goes to Fitzsiers's house to find out what has happened. It turns out that when Marty South died, he left a letter saying that he wishes to die so that Grace could forget all about him. This news troubles Grace greatly, as it makes her more determined to make amends to Fitz than to leave him behind. In an effort to clear up any misunderstandings, Grace writes Fitzpier a letter asking him to meet them at 1:00 p.m. on the following day. Fitzpiers makes his way past the wedding party and sees Grace and Fitzpiciers approaching. They talk for a while, then Fitzpaciers tells Grace that he will be leaving next month to go to Australia with Fitzpurgs father. Grace says that she would rather not live in the same place where her name has been tarnished than enter the country she has chosen. Fitzpaniers is surprised to see Grace but agrees to meet her again if she will allow it. She does so, and on their way back Fitzpier catches sight of Grace when she cries out from behind some bushes. He grabs her by the waist and pulls her down into the bushes. The trap is attached to a piece of Jane Eyre fabric used as a snareskin's dress during the Prohibition era. It also contains a silk mouth full of a bloodied spiderweb. Fitzpeniers uses this information to discover that Grace was using the trap to get away without being hurt. advertisement",0.6006058864863917,0.19874476665195376
Sons and Lovers," Part I: The refined daughter of a ""good old burgher family,"" Gertrude Coppard meets a rough-hewn miner at a Christmas dance and falls into a whirlwind romance characterized by physical passion. But soon after her marriage to Walter Morel, she realizes the difficulties of living off his meagre salary in a rented house. The couple fight and drift apart and Walter retreats to the pub after work each day. Gradually, Mrs. Morel's affections shift to her sons beginning with the oldest, William. As a boy, William is so attached to his mother that he doesn't enjoy the fair without her. As he grows older, he defends her against his father's occasional violence. Eventually, he leaves their Nottinghamshire home for a job in London, where he begins to rise up into the middle class. He is engaged, but he detests the girl's superficiality. He dies and Mrs. Morel is heartbroken, but when Paul catches pneumonia she rediscovers her love for her second son. Part II: Both repulsed by and drawn to his mother, Paul is afraid to leave her but wants to go out on his own, and needs to experience love. Gradually, he falls into a relationship with Miriam, a farm girl who attends his church. The two take long walks and have intellectual conversations about books but Paul resists, in part because his mother looks down on her. At Miriam's family's farm, Paul meets Clara Dawes, a young woman with, apparently, feminist sympathies who has separated from her husband, Baxter. Paul leaves Miriam behind as he grows more intimate with Clara, but even she cannot hold him and he returns to his mother. When his mother dies soon after, he is alone. Lawrence summarized the plot in a letter to Edward Garnett on 12 November 1912: :It follows this idea: a woman of character and refinement goes into the lower class, and has no satisfaction in her own life. She has had a passion for her husband, so her children are born of passion, and have heaps of vitality. But as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers &mdash; first the eldest, then the second. These sons are urged into life by their reciprocal love of their mother &mdash; urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives, and holds them. It's rather like Goethe and his mother and Frau von Stein and Christiana &mdash; As soon as the young men come into contact with women, there's a split. William gives his sex to a fribble, and his mother holds his soul. But the split kills him, because he doesn't know where he is. The next son gets a woman who fights for his soul &mdash; fights his mother. The son loves his mother &mdash; all the sons hate and are jealous of the father. The battle goes on between the mother and the girl, with the son as object. The mother gradually proves stronger, because of the ties of blood. The son decides to leave his soul in his mother's hands, and, like his elder brother go for passion. He gets passion. Then the split begins to tell again. But, almost unconsciously, the mother realizes what is the matter, and begins to die. The son casts off his mistress, attends to his mother dying. He is left in the end naked of everything, with the drift towards death.
","The Bottomless Bottoms David Morel is the narrator's friend and co-author of John Maclean's Sons and Loves. He lives in Sheerness with his wife and their two young children, William and Walter. They have a difficult time adjusting to life in the mining town of Shrewsbury, where there are no working moors or pickpockets; they live in poverty, disease, and disreputable habitation. The narrator tells us that he used to work as a barber but has given up doing so because he does not want to be associated with the ""poor things"" of the mining community. His only redeeming quality is his ability to laugh at people who make fun of him while making fun of them. This aspect of his character is also present throughout the book. Gulliver Morel watches her husband go off to work on behalf of a company called Carston & Waite, which plans to open a coal mine near Sherwood during the Christmas holidays. When Mr. Purdy comes home from work one day, he finds papers in his pocket indicating that money has been spent on furniture purchased for Walter and William. It turns out that this money was actually spent on food rather than on anything else. The next day Walter and Jerry go for a long walk to the town of Bestwood. They stop at Punchbowls where they indulge in pigeon racing, which results in a large sum of money being spent on the local men. Afterward, Walter gets drunk and storms into the house; he is then kicked out by his wife who tries to get him to open the door so that she can escape. The scene ends with an argument between Walter and his wife as she attempts to defend herself against Walter's drunken advances. She accuses him of neglecting her children and of not taking care of their well-being. He tells her that he will take care of them if they die. On Sunday morning, Walter returns home from work only to find Mrs. Craiglockhart suffering another stroke. Her condition worsens even further when Mr. Thorpe, the local clergyman whom Walter frequently visits every day, arrives home drunk and unwilling to give up his duties as a member of the clergy community. In spite of this, Walter manages to make it through the week without incident. The narrator tells the story of William Morel and his wife, who are estranged from each other because their husbands do not allow them to live together. They have three children under the age of eleven: William, a precocious child, Paul, and 11-year-old Paul. William's father, Henry Morel , is an alcoholic who has been living off the proceeds of gambling for several years. His alcoholism leads him to seek work as a clerk in a shoe factory. He also begins to drink heavily, but he does not want to be associated with alcohol or drugs. During this period, they lose touch with each other through frequent misunderstandings and fights. One night, when young Paul is playing pool with his friends, Morel suggests burning Arabella so that she will not fall ill. The family burns her love letters, which include extracts from her life stories. The Morels have a hard time making ends meet, especially with the poverty that they are experiencing. One Friday night, Paul goes to work at the collier's shop in Bretty for five pence each. He spends the money by pretending to buy something from them and then going back to collect it himself. During this period of intense activity, Paul becomes increasingly dissatisfied with his job prospects and begins to take an interest in architecture instead of carpentry or carpentry. The narrator tells us that William Morel has just returned from London where he is working as a lawyer. His parents are worried about him because their son Paul is so young and fearless looking. They also worry that he will not be able to find work when he returns home. Paul goes to work for Thomas Jordan at the manufacturer of surgical appliances. He meets his mother and they spend sixteen miles together on the railway. During this time, Paul is nervous about what he will become when he becomes a part-time clerk in a large factory. His fears are alleviated when he meets his ""gipsy"" , a diminutive young girl who works as a receptionist for a small firm called Thomas Jordan & Son. After spending time with her, Paul finds it hard to find a place to eat; instead, he visits his ""reconciliation boss,"" Mr. Chadwick, who treats him cruelly and contemptuously. In order to improve his chances of becoming a clerk, Paul purchases expensive items from several stores. When Paul returns home, he tells his mother how much money he has saved up so that he can go out and visit his new fiancee Gyp Western. She responds by saying that she does not want to make fun of him or his fiancee. The next Christmas, Paul sees Gyp again but without any presents. Lily comes down to visit the family, and William asks her why she is dressed so well for chapel. She explains that she likes to dress up in London clothes and has a good time with the company of Paul and Annie. William jokes about how awkward it is for Lily to be around people who don't really know what they're talking about. At one point, she tells him that he's going to have to make up for his ""shabby"" attitude toward women. He agrees, but at the same time, he doesn't want to give Lily up just yet. One day, after returning home from church, Paul finds his mother waiting for him outside their house. They go into the back garden of the Morel farmhouse where Paul works as a laborer. There, Paul sees his mother struggle against pneumonia while tending to an old coal-coated chair. The next day, Paul receives a letter telling him that his mother has died. It says that Mr. Jordan had given Paul a box containing some Christmas presents. Paul decides to take the box to London himself. The narrator tells us that Miriam is the epitome of a ""swine girl"" because she has no one to share her love with. Paul's mother tries to teach him how to use his powers of persuasion by telling him stories about castles and cemeteries in order to reinforce his pride. The narrator also gives us some brief background information on the relationship between Paul and Helen, who are both very sensitive young women. They have a strained relationship due to their parents' strict religious beliefs; they do not want to be associated with anything but religion. However, they do make an effort to maintain this strained relationship. One day, Paul asks Miriam if she would like to go out for a walk with him at night. She says yes. Afterward, he takes her on a tour of a nearby country garden. He finds a wild rose bush, which reminds him of Annie's favorite yellow croquet-cressage. This scene cementifies the narrator's belief that there is something between man and nature. On Easter Monday, Paul takes Miriam on a tour of Wingfield. She is enchanted by the place and with its natural beauty. The group stops for lunch at a nearby church before continuing on to another part of the estate called Crich. While there, Paul meets Miriam while she is dressing. They have a conversation that turns into a fight over who gets to pick up her clothes first. When they get home, Paul tells Miriam that he wants her to come visit him one more time because he thinks she would like to see him. But Miriam will not let him do it. Later in the summer, Paul asks Miriam why she does not like Mrs. De Guiche's house; she replies that she likes all the things Paul has done for her but doesn't enjoy his company as much as she used to. One night, Paul goes to watch the moon from a window overlooking the countryside. He notices an orange moon rising above them. This makes Paul want to kiss it. That evening, Paul finds Miriam sitting near him reading a poem about birdsong. Suddenly, Paul realizes that he loves Miriam so much that he puts his arm around her. During the spring, Paul becomes increasingly dissatisfied with his life. He begins to suspect that Miriam is in love with him and will continue to do so even though she does not reciprocate his affections. One rainy day, Paul goes for a walk near Nethermere on the property owned by the Morel family. While walking he sees an Orion constellation, which reminds him of Earth's equestrian system. This causes Paul to turn against his mother who has been neglecting him all along. When Paul returns home from this walk, he finds his mother completely disheveled and unkempt. She blames him for her daughter's unhappiness. Paul tries to help his mother but fails miserably. The next morning, Paul meets up with some of his old school friends and asks them to give him more time to improve his education. Paul then takes out a large packet of money belonging to Annie and gives it to Paul as a token of his gratitude. Paul tells his mother that he loves her very much. After tea, Paul tells Miriam that he doesn't love her anymore. He blames himself for her unhappiness and wants to do something else with her instead. She tries to convince him that she loves him too but he won't listen. One Easter Sunday, Paul takes his mother on a walk in the country. They stop at a roadside thrush pond where they find eggs crunched by a bulldog. Paul asks Miriam why she is so sad. She says it's because she has been neglecting her family. The next day, Paul goes to visit Mrs. Beadle, who lives nearby. While Paul is there, he meets up with some of the farmhands from whom he works as a cart driver. Afterward, Paul invites Clara to come along with him one Saturday afternoon. During their walk, Paul sees Clara sitting in front of a book while listening to music. He encourages her to sit down and enjoy herself. Later, when Paul returns home, he finds out that Clara has broken a fence three times. This makes Paul even more determined to see Clara. Paul and Annie are married almost immediately, but Paul still wants to marry. He tells his mother that he doesn't want her to go through life without any one caring for her or doing anything for her because of how much money Annie has saved. She says she'll make up for it with a servant. When Annie dies, Paul goes to visit Clara at the Morel home. Clara is there too, so Paul asks her if she'd like to come live with them. She does not want to hear about it, so they part ways. Paul continues to pursue his dream of becoming a singer-songwriter in order to earn more money. At the age of twenty-two, Paul meets Clara again, this time as a member of the Suffragettes. They get along well, though Paul's sense of obligation toward his mother gradually wears off Paul tells Fanny that he is going to visit her on his birthday and asks her to meet him before she begins the letters. She agrees, but only after he tells her of all the gifts Clara has been giving him since their arrival in England. Paul goes to see Fanny for the first time. They spend a lot of time talking about love and marriage; they even have a conversation about religion together. Paul says that he loves Miriam more than any other woman. One Sunday afternoon, Paul takes Clara out for a walk. When they get back home, Paul admits that he wants to marry again. He also confesses that he does not like it when people talk about purity because it makes them feel guilty and less conscious of what they are doing. However, this confession convinces Clara that there must be some sort of separation between them from each other. During the summer, Paul tells his mother that he is breaking off from Miriam because he does not want her to marry him. This news upsets Clara even more and causes her to become increasingly bitter towards him. One afternoon, she tells him that she has decided they should break off. He says that he will break off only with her once they are married. They go for a walk in the forest on Sunday afternoons. On their way back home, Paul asks Clara if she would like to meet him. Clara agrees, but when they arrive at the Forest of Ardenne, Clara becomes very agitated and refuses to allow them to continue their relationship. She also refuses to let him touch her breast during their walk. After some time, Clara allows Paul to kiss her. The pair embrace and fall in love. Paul tells Clara that he is going to visit her at the train station and asks her if she will mind if he brings her some of his art supplies. She does not want to do anything but wait for him until he has something ""big and intense"" . Paul goes on a long, drawn-out conversation with Clara about all sorts of things. He even takes her picture of an old lady named Annie who lives next door. They talk for a bit before Paul leaves to go see Clara. Clara comes back later in the afternoon after Paul has gone off to see another actress. Paul meets Clara again as they are walking home together. Paul tries to get Clara to agree to meet up with Paul at the theater one night. But Clara refuses because Paul wants to spend the evening with Clara instead. Paul's mother finally agrees to let him have the night off. Paul decides to head over to Mrs. Dixon's house where he will be spending the night while Clara stays with her mother. Paul confides in Clara that he has had an affair with Mrs. Beadle, the widow of Paul's dead mother. Clara responds by saying that she does not know what to do about Baxter because she married him. Paul says that he will let Baxter do whatever he wants with his life. Clara is shocked at this statement and tells Paul that she would like to be rid of her ""foolishness"" if only for the sake of her own sanity. Paul tries to convince Clara that there is nothing wrong with him but that he cannot love her as a person. Clara continues to insist that Paul must give her something back. One day, Paul takes Clara on a long walk along the seashore. While they are out walking, Paul accidentally bumps into a man who is apparently Baxter. Paul realizes that it is Clara whom he loves. Clara begins to feel guilty for treating the man so cruelly during their time together. She also feels guilty for mistreating Baxter even more than before. They begin to develop romantic relationships again. Paul and Annie spend four days together in Sheffield before returning to England. Paul goes to Nottingham to visit an old friend of his, Newton's, who lives nearby. While there, Paul tells Morel that he will be taking Annie home when she is well enough to go back to Sheffield for a few weeks. Meanwhile, Clara has developed a condition called ""thyposis,"" a psychological disorder that renders her unable to walk or talk. She also suffers from typhoid fever. Paul tries to take advantage of this condition by pretending that it is caused by the mining industry. He even gives Annie a small portion of his inheritance from Sheffield. In November, Paul visits Dawes at the Wellcome House, where Paul works as a housekeeper. Paul then takes Annie on a trip to the seashore with Paul. Paul says goodbye to Annie one last time. The narrator notes that Paul seems to have lost most of his sense of self-control during these visits. Paul and Annie mourn the loss of their mother, who died a few weeks before Paul's own. Clara leaves Sheffield for a teaching college in Nottingham; Morel moves to Nottingham with Clara. Paul becomes increasingly depressed at the state of affairs between his father and Clara, whom he has been neglecting since leaving school. He begins to drink heavily and smoke, which causes him to lose consciousness. One day, as the rain begins to fall, Paul sees Clara on her way home. She begs him to marry her, saying that she would rather die than go abroad. Paul gives in and agrees to meet her later. The following week, Clara returns to Sheffield but Paul does not see her again until three days later. At the same time, an acquaintance of Clara's tells Paul that Clara will be returning to Sheffield after Christmas. advertisement",1.3702667787722318,0.19999999618563333
The Taming of the Shrew," Prior to the first act, an induction frames the play as a ""kind of history"" played in front of a befuddled drunkard named Christopher Sly who is tricked into believing that he is a lord. In the play performed for Sly, the ""Shrew"" is Katherina Minola, the eldest daughter of Baptista Minola, a lord in Padua. Katherina's temper is notorious and it is thought no man would ever wish to marry her. On the other hand, two men – Hortensio and Gremio – are eager to marry her younger sister Bianca. However, Baptista has sworn not to allow his younger daughter to marry before Katherina is wed, much to the despair of her suitors, who agree that they will work together to marry off Katherina so that they will be free to compete for Bianca. The plot becomes more complex when Lucentio, who has recently come to Padua to attend university, sees Bianca and instantly falls in love with her. Lucentio overhears Baptista announce that he is on the lookout for tutors for his daughters, so he has his servant Tranio pretend to be him while he disguises himself as a Latin tutor named Cambio, so that he can woo Bianca behind Baptista's back. In the meantime, Petruchio arrives in Padua, accompanied by his servant, Grumio. Petruchio tells his old friend Hortensio that he has set out to enjoy life after the death of his father and that his main goal is to wed. Hearing this, Hortensio seizes the opportunity to recruit Petruchio as a suitor for Katherina. He also has Petruchio present to Baptista a music tutor named Litio (Hortensio himself in disguise). Thus, Lucentio and Hortensio, pretending to be the teachers Cambio and Litio, attempt to woo Bianca unbeknownst to her father, and to one another. Petruchio, to counter Katherina's shrewish nature, woos her with reverse psychology, pretending that every harsh thing she says or does is kind and gentle. Katherina allows herself to become engaged to Petruchio, and they are married in a farcical ceremony during which (amongst other things) he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine, and then takes her home against her will. Once they are gone, Gremio and Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily outbidding Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than the real Lucentio actually possesses, and Baptista determines that once Lucentio's father confirms the dowry, Bianca and Tranio can marry. Tranio thus decides that they will need someone to pretend to be Vincentio, Lucentio's father, at some point in the near future. Elsewhere, as part of their scheme, Tranio persuades Hortensio that Bianca is not worthy of his attentions, thus removing any problems he may cause. Meanwhile, in Petruchio's house, he begins the ""taming"" of his new wife. She is refused food and clothing because nothing – according to Petruchio – is good enough for her; he claims perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress doesn't fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also sets about disagreeing with everything she says, and forcing her to agree with everything he says, no matter how absurd; on their way back to Padua to attend Bianca's wedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims that ""if you please to call it a rush-candle,/Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me"" (4.5.14–15). Along the way, they meet Vincentio who is also on his way to Padua, and Katherina agrees with Petruchio when he declares that Vincentio is a woman and then apologises to Vincentio when Petruchio tells her he is a man. Meanwhile, back in Padua, Lucentio and Tranio convince a passing pedant to pretend to be Vincentio and confirm the dowry for Bianca. The man does so, and Baptista is happy for Bianca to wed Lucentio (actually Tranio in disguise). Bianca then secretly elopes with the real Lucentio. However, Vincentio arrives in Padua, and encounters the Pedant, who claims to be Lucentio's father. Tranio (still disguised as Lucentio) appears, and the Pedant acknowledges him to be his son Lucentio. There is much confusion about identities, and the real Vincentio is set to be arrested when the real Lucentio appears with his newly betrothed Bianca, and reveals all to a bewildered Baptista and Vincentio. Lucentio explains everything that has happened and all is forgiven by the two fathers. Meanwhile, Hortensio has married a rich widow, and so in the final scene of the play there are three newly married couples at Baptista's banquet; Bianca and Lucentio, the widow and Hortensio, and Katherina and Petruchio. Because of the general opinion that Petruchio is married to a shrew, a quarrel breaks out about whose wife is the most obedient. Petruchio proposes a wager whereby each will send a servant to call for their wives, and whichever comes most obediently will have won the wager for her husband. Katherina is the only one of the three who comes, winning the wager for Petruchio. At the end of the play, after the other two wives have been hauled into the room by Katherina, she gives a speech on the subject of why wives should always obey their husbands and the play ends with Baptista, Hortensio and Lucentio marvelling at how successfully Petruchio has tamed the shrew.
","The scene is set in a Bedchamber at the Lord's house. The Hostess, dressed as a servant, tries to persuade Baptista to let her stay with him while he goes off on a hunting trip. A messenger arrives with news that Baptista has agreed to let his daughter Katherine be his wife after she marries Vincentio and gains access to all of his property and courtesies. He asks Baptista if he can marry her without having to give up his land and possessions; Baptista says yes, but only for a short time. When Baptista hears this news, however, he storms out of the room. Meanwhile, Hortenio enters disguised as Lucentios drunken father. In an attempt to cheer Lucentias drunken father up, they disguise themselves as musicians and write hymns. They are soon joined by their attendants, who tell them about Baptista plans to woo Bianca through music and Latin language. Baptista enters with his daughters, asking for their hand in marriage. They assure Baptista that they will have a wedding on Sunday and then go to Venice to buy wedding apparel. When Baptista learns of the wedding plans, he becomes very upset. He tells them not to be so hard-hearted as to give away all of Bianca if she does not like him. At this point, Hortenio comes up with a plan to trick Lucentios into agreeing to marry Bianca instead of Kate. The plan works out well, though it is still early in the morning when Lucentius and Kate are supposed to be at the wedding. As soon as the wedding is over, however, everyone rushes off to prepare for the big day. Scene iii begins with Petrochio and his entourage arriving at Baptista's house. In the midst of preparations, one of the hired pedants reveals himself to be Vincentiano, a handsome young man who has just returned from Padua after spending twenty years abroad. After much coaxing and bawdy conversation, Pedante finally agrees to help Lucentias get married. Scene iv also opens with scenes iii and ivy tree scene ii. A group of piper heads toward Baptista because they want to know where Kate is. advertisement",0.783634494,0.24959999541934083
Atala," The frame story: A young disillusioned Frenchman, René, has joined an Indian tribe and married a woman named Céluta. On a hunting expedition, one moonlit night, René asks Chactas, the old man who adopted him, to relate the story of his life. At the age of seventeen, the Natchez Chactas loses his father during a battle against the Muscogees. He flees to St Augustine, Florida, where he is raised in the household of the Spaniard Lopez. After 2½ years, he sets out for home, but is captured by the Muscogees and Seminoles. The chief Simagan sentences him to be burnt in their village. The women take pity on him during the weeks of travel, and each night bring him gifts. Atala, the half-caste Christian daughter of Simagan, tries in vain to help him escape. On arrival at Apalachucla, his bonds are loosed and he is saved from death by her intervention. They run away and roam the wilderness for 27 days before being caught in a huge storm. While they are sheltering, Atala tells Chactas that her father was Lopez, and he realises that she is the daughter of his erstwhile benefactor. Lightning strikes a tree close by, and they run at random before hearing a church bell. Encountering a dog, they are met by its owner, Père Aubry, and he leads them through the storm to his idyllic mission. Aubry's kindness and force of personality impress Chactas greatly. Atala falls in love with Chactas, but cannot marry him as she has taken a vow of chastity. In despair she takes poison. Aubry assumes that she is merely ill, but in the presence of Chactas she reveals what she has done, and Chactas is filled with anger until the missionary tells them that in fact Christianity permits the renunciation of vows. They tend her, but she dies, and the day after the funeral, Chactas takes Aubry's advice and leaves the mission. In an epilogue it is revealed that Aubry was later killed by Cherokees, and that, according to Chactas's granddaughter, neither René nor the aged Chactas survived a massacre during an uprising. The full account of Chactas's wanderings after Atala's death, in Les Natchez, gives a somewhat different version of their fates.
","This chapter introduces the first edition of a book called Atala , which was originally published in 1789. The author explains that he wanted to go to America and study the behavior of the native American tribes. He decided to do so because Captain Cook had doubted his ability to interpret human nature. In 1848, Chateau-Rouche decides to make an epic about the cannibalism of the De Lacey family due to the French Revolution. He begins with a preface explaining how he came up with the idea for this epic: atala is a story about a man who has come to America to learn about the ways of the savage Indians. After learning about them through reading their stories, Chaceau- Roussillon agrees to help translate the text into English as well as Spanish. When René's mother comes to see him, she tries to convince him to let her go with her. She also convinces him to accompany her back to France. Atala reunites with René and they travel to the Hermitage, which is located in the mountains of northern Kentucky. There, they encounter a Franciscan friar named Philip Lopez, who has been living at St. Augustine for thirty years. The friar explains that he was sent by God to save his family from an Indian tribe whose religion forbids them to eat or drink native foods. He also explains how he came to love Atala as a young girl when she was only six years old. In order to help her forget about her parents' deaths, he takes her under his wing and leads her to a religious grotto where she learns more about the history of Christianity and its teachings. Atala's situation worsens. She begins to lose the strength and spirit of her former self; she is also beginning to lose her sense of propriety. Her father tries to find a way to help her, but all he can find is an old man who has been neglecting his daughter for forty years. The Old Man finally agrees to release Atala from her vows. As time goes by, however things do not seem to be going as well as they should have. In fact, atala is now experiencing signs of grief and even death herself. After two days, she gives birth to a baby girl whom she calls Atala ""soul"" and whose parents died in childbirth. This little girl becomes very beautiful when she falls asleep on top of the sleeping infant. When she wakes up, she sees that it was Father Aubrys body lying on the ground next to a tree with a bloodied fawn around its neck. It turns out that this is the child Atala left behind after being separated from her family for so long. advertisement",1.9460506556401038,0.24110671440539622
Anne of Avonlea," Anne is about to start her first term teaching at the Avonlea school, although she will still continue her studies at home with Gilbert, who is teaching at the nearby White Sands School. The book soon introduces Anne's new and problematic neighbor, Mr. Harrison, and his foul-mouthed parrot, as well as the twins, Davy and Dora. They are the children of Marilla's third cousin and she takes them in when their mother dies while their uncle is out of the country. Dora is a nice, well-behaved girl, somewhat boring in her perfect behaviour. Ironically Davy is an exact opposite, much more of a handful and constantly getting into many scrapes. They are initially meant to stay only a short time, but the twins' uncle postpones his return to collect the twins and then eventually dies. Both Anne and Marilla are relieved (Marilla inwardly of course) to know the twins will remain with her. Other characters introduced are some of Anne's new pupils, such as Paul Irving, an American boy living with his grandmother in Avonlea while his widower father works in the States. He delights Anne with his imagination and whimsical ways, which are reminiscent of Anne's in her childhood. Later in the book, Anne and her friends meet Miss Lavendar Lewis, a sweet but lonely lady in her 40s who had been engaged to Paul's father 25 years before, but parted from him after a disagreement. At the end of the book, Mr. Irving returns and he and Miss Lavendar marry. Anne discovers the delights and troubles of being a teacher, takes part in the raising of Davy and Dora, and organizes the A.V.I.S. (Avonlea Village Improvement Society) together with Gilbert, Diana, and Fred Wright, though their efforts to improve the town are not always successful. The Society takes up a subscription to repaint an old town hall, only to have the painter provide the wrong color of paint, turning the hall into a bright blue eyesore. Towards the end of the book, Mrs. Rachel Lynde's husband dies and Mrs. Lynde moves in with Marilla at Green Gables, allowing Anne to go to college at last. She and Gilbert make plans to attend Redmond College in the fall. This book sees Anne maturing slightly, even though she still cannot avoid getting into a number of her familiar scrapes, as only Anne can—some of which include selling her neighbor's cow (having mistaken it for her own), or getting stuck in a broken duck house roof while peeping into a pantry window.
","Mr. Harrison sells his farm and hires a small boy named Virgil to help him cook. Anne tries to predict the future, but it doesn't work out so well. She starts to worry about how her house will look when she gets older. Then there are rumors that someone has broken into Anne's house. It turns out that this person is actually Mr. Harker, who bought the farm back in April. The narrator gives us some background on Mr. Harveys character: he was known as a crank because he would buy things from people without telling them what they were doing. He used to be really close to being a great preacher, but now he seems like a real crank. Also, he uses Anne to make fun of Mrs. Cuthberts kids. Finally, Anne tells Marilla all about her plan to open up an improvement society for Avonllea. When Marilla asks why Anne does not whip her own cow, Anne explains that she sold Dolly to George Herrtle . This makes Marilla even more ticked-off than before. Anne also says that she wants to get rid of Captain Donnithorne. Anne arrives at school and is greeted by bright, smiling faces. She tries to prepare a speech for her pupils but can't remember any of it because she cannot remember how to use the pencils in her classroom. Anne also meets Paul Irving, a ten-year-old boy who reminds her of Annie Pye from High School. Anne decides that she wants to make Paul like her so that he will love her even more. At home, Anne finds Paul sitting with his sister Prudence Rogerson. They have a conversation about crickets and water bottles. Anne then goes over to visit Mr. Haydock's house where she sees Catherine Andrews, an old woman who has been living there for fifty years. Catherine asks Anne if she can take charge of the twins. Anne says that she does not think they will be very well taken care of, especially since Mrs. Laurence Lynde refuses to allow Anne to take custody of them until next year. After Catherine leaves, Anne tells Marilla all about her trip to meet up with Captain Donnithorne, whom she calls ""the Most Knacky Professor."" The narrator concludes this chapter by stating that Anne is as good a person as any third cousin. Davy and Anne have a hard time reconciling their different personalities. On Tuesday morning, they go to church only to find Dora sitting in the pew with her infant daughter, who is crying out because she has been caught in a bugle trap. The narrator notes that there are no accidents on this particular day. In fact, one of those accidents happens: Davy accidentally drops a poisonous caterpillar into Marilla's daughter-in-law's dress while pretending to pick it up. This causes Marilla to lose control of her temper and send her home without supper. When Anne gets home, she tells Mr. Jarndyce that he should wash his face regularly so that he doesn't get miffed when he does something wrong. He also says that he will never wash his hands again until he is old enough to clean up after himself. Anne tries to cheer him up by telling him how much she loves him even though he acts like a crazy person. She asks him if he would like to come over for dinner. At first, he refuses, but then he convinces himself that he can do whatever he wants whenever he wants. After dinner, Anne goes to tell Mrs. Jarldyce what happened. It turns out that Dr. Manette had found a bunch of wedding love letters hidden in her parents’ attic during the honeymoon period. They all ended up going to the Hartsfield-Jacksonville International School together. Anne writes a letter to her teacher, asking her to write about an incident she has had at Aunt Marys house. The story begins with Anne explaining that she is late for a visit because she accidentally dropped a piece of cake on the ground while trying to pick it up. She also explains how she got there by accident and then ended up getting knocked over by a rocker. After the lesson, Anne goes back to school where she meets Diana, who asks her to help her celebrate her birthday. They all agree to do so, but first they have to find a way to celebrate their upcoming bazaar in order to make themselves feel better before they start making plans for another one. Anne decides to ask Mrs. Esther Lynde if she can come over and help set up a little party for the ladies' aid society. She finds out that Mr. Brownlow Senior High School is holding a bicentennial celebration next week, which will coincide with the election of the year. Anne invites the girls to dance around the flowerbeds of old Mrs. Hester's garden as a way of celebrating her birthday without worrying about what other people think. The narrator tells us that the narrator is not alone in her fear. The narrator notes that many people are outraged by this development, including Anne herself; they feel that there must be a way to prevent Parker from doing something rash like renting out his fences and putting advertisements all over them. They also note that some members of the Improvisation Society disapprove of Parker because he does not have much social standing. After the meeting ends, Anne leaves the key in her pocket for a few minutes to let everyone know what has happened. When she returns home, she discovers that Diana and Miles are waiting for her at their house. She goes into the kitchen to find Dora picking peas when she sees an old silver platter with flowers on it. At dinner, Anne tells Marilla how excited she is about having a big party planned for Thursday night. It turns out Mrs.Morgan will be coming to visit later that evening. Diana goes home and tells Anne that she has news for her: Mrs. Goddard is getting married in a few days. Anne wants to know where her sleep is, so she asks Marilla if she can borrow a Willows platter from a nearby store. When Marilla says no, Anne runs off to find the Copps girls on Tory Road who have a beautiful willowware platters. Anne finds Gilbert Bledsoe at the grocery store. They talk for a while about how much they love each other, but then suddenly there is a knock on the door. Anne rushes out to greet the new arrivals. It turns out it is none other than Mr. Laurence, the local school superintendent. Anne also learns that Dora plans to marry him when she grows up. Anne decides to surprise everyone by having a nice birthday party. The next day, Anne tells Diana and her friends that she is going to visit the Lavendar school in order to meet up with Aunt Charlotte, who is away for a few days. They arrive just before 5:00 p.m., and while they are putting away their horses, Anne catches Priscillilla staring intensely at her nose. It turns out that it is scarlet because Anne used red dye from Marilla's lotion as a mark of mourning for Aunt Charlotte. After dinner, the girls have a walk around the grounds where they will be staying for the evening. While on the walk, Anne runs into Miss Lavinia Cuthberts old friend, Charlottendorf, who invites them over for tea. She also invites them to stay overnight at Echo Lodge , which is an old country house built by Mr. Irving. The narrator notes that this very night marks the beginning of a new chapter in Anne's novel. A Prophet in his Own Country A May day, Avonllea residents are excited over a series of avonlesa-related notes, signed ""Observer,"" which appear in the Daily Enterprise. The notes seem to be sneering jokes at Gilbert and Charlie , but they do mention that there is a wedding planned for the following evening. Inevitably, rumors spread that the weatherman has predicted thunderstorms throughout the province during the late afternoon and early evening on May 24. Anne runs into her twins as she heads home from school. She meets Marilla who tells her that Mr. Hoseason has been found dead; Marilla also tells Anne that he is buried in Anne's lap. Anne rushes off to tell Marilla about the news. Later, Anne goes to visit Mrs. Rouncewell, an elderly woman who lives next door to where Anne works. When Anne returns home, she finds that it has been six months since Anne last saw her. Anne says that she will ask Mrs. rouncewell to help her with her education so that she can move to Redmond College. Paul is upset that his teacher, Jane Andrews, will not be returning to school. Diana worries that the improvement society will fall apart when Gilbert and Anne are gone. She tells Anne that she wants to know if she cares for Gilbert or not. Anne says that she does care for Gilbert because he reminds her of him every day. The next morning, Anne goes to visit Paul in the Irving home. He tells her that he has a secret: he has come to visit Esther, who loves him very much. They have tea together and talk about old times. Then they go out for a walk. When they return home, Anne finds Paul sitting on someone else's lap. It turns out that it is Stephen Irving, whom she had been talking to earlier. This makes Anne even more determined to get rid of him. advertisement",0.8719989022000741,0.23367697181904906
The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse," Danny begins his tale regretting the length of his tail until he is corrected by Mr. Toad. Then he has a series of stalkings by Reddy and Granny Fox. He is captured by Hooty the Owl and escapes mid-flight to Peter Rabbit's briar patch. Peter goes to Farmer Brown's peach orchard and gets caught in a snare and barely escapes himself. Finally Danny gets trapped in a tin can and must use his wits to escape Reddy Fox again.
","This chapter introduces the adventures of a small dog, named Danny Meadow. In this chapter, we learn that he is worried about his tail, which causes him to grow grumpy and eventually give up his pretense of being a homely dog. He also learns that Whitefoot has lived in Green Meadows for several years and that they have been keeping an eye on him. One day, however, he sees Bowser the hound wandering around the grassy meadows looking for food. This makes him realize that it is time to go back to where he started off: the old Briar Patch. The following morning, after some coaxing from Redding Fox, he finds himself in the forest again with no food or shelter. Meanwhile, at the other end of town, Tommy Tuck's chicken coop has made its way into the forest through a hole in the tree line. As soon as Tom Rabbit gets there, he realizes that all the berries are gone. And what does Tom Rabbit eat? Well, well, not exactly what you'd expect. But hey, who can resist a tasty little snack when you've got so much to eat? advertisement",0.8873673212173623,0.14423076525194167
Measure for Measure," Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna, makes it known that he intends to leave the city on a diplomatic mission. He leaves the government in the hands of a strict judge, Angelo. Claudio, a young nobleman, is betrothed/unofficially married to Juliet. At the time, marriages were supposed to be announced by banns in advance. Due to lack of money, Claudio and Juliet did not observe all the technicalities. This did not make them unique however; at the time most people (including the Church) would have considered them married. Technically, however, all the formalities for a civil marriage had not been followed and so a strict judge might rule that they were not legally married. Angelo, as the personification of the law, decides to enforce the ruling that fornication is punishable by death, and since he does not accept the validity of the marriage, Claudio is sentenced to be executed. Claudio's friend, Lucio, visits Claudio's sister, Isabella, a novice nun, and asks her to intercede with Angelo on Claudio's behalf. Isabella obtains an audience with Angelo, and pleads for mercy for Claudio. Over the course of two scenes between Angelo and Isabella, it becomes clear that he harbours lustful thoughts about her, and he eventually offers her a deal: Angelo will spare Claudio's life if Isabella yields him her virginity. Isabella refuses, but she also realises that (due to Angelo's austere reputation) she will not be believed if she makes a public accusation against him. Instead she visits her brother in prison and counsels him to prepare himself for death. Claudio vehemently begs Isabella to save his life, but Isabella refuses. As a novice nun, she feels that she cannot sacrifice her own immortal soul (and that of Claudio's, if he causes her to lose her virtue) to save Claudio's transient earthly life. The Duke has not in fact left the city, but remains there disguised as a friar (Lodowick) in order to spy on the city's affairs, and especially on the actions of Angelo. In his guise as a friar he befriends Isabella and arranges two tricks to thwart Angelo's evil intentions: #First, a ""bed trick"" is arranged. Angelo has previously refused to fulfill the betrothal binding him to Mariana, because her dowry had been lost at sea. Isabella sends word to Angelo that she has decided to submit to him, making it a condition of their meeting that it occurs in perfect darkness and in silence. Mariana agrees to take Isabella's place, and she has sex with Angelo, although he continues to believe he has enjoyed Isabella. (In some interpretations of the law, this constitutes consummation of their betrothal, and therefore their marriage. This is the same interpretation that assumes that Claudio and Juliet are legally married.) #After having sex with Mariana (who he thinks is Isabella), Angelo goes back on his word, sending a message to the prison that he wishes to see Claudio's head, and necessitating the ""head trick."" The Duke first attempts to arrange the execution of another prisoner whose head can be sent instead of Claudio's. However, the villain Barnardine refuses to be executed in his drunken state. As luck would have it, a pirate named Ragozine, of similar appearance to Claudio, has recently died of a fever, so his head is sent to Angelo instead. This main plot concludes with the 'return' to Vienna of the Duke as himself. Isabella and Mariana publicly petition him, and he hears their claims against Angelo, which Angelo smoothly denies. As the scene develops, it appears that Friar Lodowick will be blamed for the 'false' accusations levelled against Angelo. The Duke leaves Angelo to judge the cause against Lodowick, but returns in disguise moments later when Lodowick is summoned. Eventually the friar reveals himself to be the Duke, thereby exposing Angelo as a liar and Isabella and Mariana as truthful. He proposes that Angelo be executed but first compels him to marry Mariana— with his estate going to Mariana as her new dowry, ""to buy you a better husband"". Mariana pleads for Angelo's life, even enlisting the aid of Isabella (who is not yet aware her brother Claudio is still living). The Duke pretends not to heed the women's petition, and only after revealing that Claudio has not, in fact, been executed, relents. The Duke then proposes marriage to Isabella. Isabella does not reply, and her reaction is interpreted differently in different productions: her silent acceptance of his proposal is the most common in performance. This is one of the ""open silences"" of the play. A sub-plot concerns Claudio's friend Lucio, who frequently slanders the duke to the friar, and in the last act slanders the friar to the duke, providing opportunities for comic consternation on Vincentio's part and landing Lucio in trouble when it is revealed that the duke and the friar are one and the same. His punishment, like Angelo's, is to be forced into an undesired marriage: in this case with the prostitute Kate Keepdown.

The Trial," On his thirtieth birthday, the chief financial officer of a bank, Josef K., is unexpectedly arrested by two unidentified agents from an unspecified agency for an unspecified crime. The agents' boss later arrives and holds a mini tribunal in the room of K.'s neighbor, Fräulein Bürstner. K. is not taken away, however, but left ""free"" to await instructions from the Committee of Affairs. He goes to work, and that night apologizes to Fräulein Bürstner for the intrusion into her room. At the end of the conversation he suddenly kisses her. K. receives a phone calling summoning him to court, and the coming Sunday is arranged as the date. No time is set and the address is given to him. The address turns out to be a huge tenement building. K. has to explore to find the court, which turns out to be in the attic. The room is airless, shabby, and crowded, and although he has no idea what he is charged with, or what authorizes the process, makes a long speech denigrating the whole process, including the agents who arrested him, and during which an attendant's wife is raped. He then returns home. K. later goes to visit the court again, although he has not been summoned. Court is not in session. He instead talks with the attendant's wife, who attempts to seduce him into taking her away, and who gives him more information about the process and offers to help him. K. later goes with the attendant to a higher level of the attic where it turns out that the offices of the court are housed, which are shabby and airless. K. returns home to find Fräulein Montag, a lodger from another room, moving in with Fräulein Bürstner. He suspects that this is to prevent him from pursuing his affair with the latter woman. Yet another lodger, Captain Lanz, appears to be in league with Montag. Later, in a store room at his own bank, K. discovers the two agents, who arrested him, being whipped by a flogger for asking K. for bribes, as a result of complaints K. made at court. K. tries to argue with the flogger, saying that the men need not be whipped, but the flogger cannot be swayed. The next day he returns to the store room and is shocked to find everything as he had found it the day before, including the Whipper and the two agents. K. is visited by his uncle, who was K.'s guardian. The uncle seems distressed by K.'s predicament. At first sympathetic, he becomes concerned K. is underestimating the seriousness of the case. The uncle introduces K. to a lawyer, who is attended by Leni, a nurse, who K.'s uncle suspects is the advocate's mistress. During the discussion it becomes clear how different this process is from regular legal proceedings – guilt is assumed, the bureaucracy running it is vast with many levels, and everything is secret, from the charge, to the rules of the court, to the authority behind the courts – even the identity of the judges at the higher levels. The attorney tells him that he can prepare a brief for K., but since the charge is unknown and the rules are unknown, it is difficult work. It also never may be read. Yet it is very important. The lawyer says that his most important task is to deal with powerful court officials behinds the scenes. As they talk, the lawyer reveals that the Chief Clerk of the Court has been sitting hidden in the darkness of a corner. The Chief Clerk emerges to join the conversation, but K. is called away by Leni, who takes him to the next room, where she offers to help him and seduces him. They have a sexual encounter. Afterwards K. meets his uncle outside, who is angry and, who claims that K.'s lack of respect has also hurt K.'s case. K. visits the lawyer several times. The lawyer tells him incessantly how dire his situation is and tells many stories of other hopeless clients and of his behind-the-scenes efforts on behalf of these clients, and brags about his many connections. The brief is never complete. K.'s work at the bank deteriorates as he is consumed with worry about his case. K. is surprised by one of his bank clients, who tells K. that he is aware that K. is dealing with a trial. The client learned of K.'s case from Titorelli, a painter, who told the client about K.'s case and has dealings with the court. The client advises K. to go to Titorelli for advice. Titorelli lives in the attic of a tenement in a suburb on the opposite side of town from the court that K. visited. Three teenage girls taunt K. on the steps and tease him sexually. Titorelli turns out to be an official painter of portraits for the court – an inherited position, and has a deep understanding of the process. K. learns that, to Titorelli's knowledge, not a single defendant has ever been acquitted. He sets out K.'s options and offers to help K. with either. The options are: obtain a provisional verdict of innocence from the lower court, which can be overturned at any time by higher levels of the court leading to re-initiation of the process; or curry favor with the lower judges to keep the process moving albeit at a glacial pace. Titorelli has K. leave through a small back door as the girls are blocking the door through with K. entered. To K.'s shock, the door opens into another warren of the court's offices – again shabby and airless. K. decides to take control of matters himself and visits his lawyer with the intention of dismissing him. At the lawyer's office he meets a downtrodden individual, Block, a client who offers K. some insight from a client's perspective. Block's case has continued for five years and he has gone from being a successful businessman to being almost bankrupt and is virtually enslaved by his dependence on the lawyer and Leni, with whom he appears to be sexually involved. The lawyer mocks Block in front of K. for his dog-like subservience. This experience further poisons K.'s opinion of his lawyer. (This chapter was left unfinished by the author.) K. is asked by the bank to show an Italian client around local places of cultural interest, but the Italian client, short of time, asks K. to take him only to the cathedral, setting a time to meet there. When the client doesn't show up, K. explores the cathedral which is empty except for an old woman and a church official. K. notices a priest who seems to be preparing to give a sermon from a small second pulpit, and K. begins to leave, lest it begin and K. be compelled to stay for its entirety. Instead of giving a sermon, the priest calls out K.'s name. K. approaches the pulpit and the priest berates him for his attitude toward the trial and for seeking help, especially from women. K. asks him to come down and the two men walk inside the cathedral. The priest works for the court as a chaplain, and tells K. a fable, (which has been published separately as Before the Law) that is meant to explain his situation. K. and the priest discuss the parable. The priest tells K. that the parable is an ancient text of the court, and many generations of court officials have given interpretations. On the eve of K.'s thirty-first birthday, two men arrive at his apartment. He has been waiting for them, and he offers little resistance – indeed the two men take direction from K. as they walk through town. K. leads them to a quarry where the two men place K's head on a discarded block. One of the men produces a double-edged butcher knife, and as the two men pass it back and forth between them, the narrator tells us that ""K. knew then precisely, that it would have been his duty to take the knife...and thrust it into himself."" He does not take the knife. One of the men holds his shoulder and pulls him up and the other man stabs him in the heart and twists the knife twice. K.'s last words are: ""Like a dog!""
","K. is arrested the next morning for refusing to eat breakfast with his new supervisor, Franz and another policeman. The police officer tells K. that he should not be allowed to stay where he is until he has presented himself in person. When K. refuses to give them his identification documents, the policemen force him to show them his arrest warrant. After K. explains what happened, the supervisor asks him if he can have a private meeting with the former supervisor. He says yes, but this will only make it more difficult for K. when he tries to explain how he got into the trouble. Later that night, at half past 11:00, while K. is sitting in his office waiting for someone, he runs into an old woman whom he recognizes as Mrs. Gurbach's supervisor, Kaminer. This makes K. even more dispirited because he realizes that she must have seen him there before. She also knows that Kaminer had been trying to talk to her about the matter earlier. But Kaminer won't tell her why. K. is informed that there will be a hearing concerning K. in the next few days. The hearing will take place at 9:00 on Sunday afternoons. After listening for a time to see if K. has anything to say, he finally agrees to go along with the hearing. On his way out of the courtroom, K' finds himself surrounded by rows of people who do not seem to be paying attention to him much. He sees a woman whom he recognizes as the victim of a domestic violence incident. She tells K. that she wants to know why he was arrested and how he should respond to her questions. K'.s response? ""I refuse to accept them."" As K. walks toward the hearing, he encounters Hasterer's examining judge , who tries to get him to give an explanation of what happened to him when he left the courtroom. This makes K. even more determined to defend himself against the judge . K. gets into a lengthy argument with the examine judge about whether or not K. is a good house painter. When it comes time to write this speech down, K.'ll have to leave immediately. K. tries to convince the woman not to meddle in the court proceedings against him; K. has no intention of staying any longer, and his position as an examiner is too precarious for him now. He tells the woman that he will go with her wherever she wants if she will just stay put. She responds by saying that she will come back whenever she likes. When K. leaves, a young woman approaches him and asks him why he is waiting at the court office. The young man explains that he has been made an officer of the courts but that he does not yet have enough money to pay for medical treatment. This makes K. even more determined to get out of this situation before it becomes unmanageable. K. goes to visit Miss M. and finds that she has refused his request for a personal meeting. He goes to her room and knocks on the door; there is no one there. She tells K. that she wants him to come see her. When he opens the door , he finds that it is empty except for two beds, three chairs, and a wardrobe. It looks exactly as it did when K. first arrived at the dispatch house. The only thing in the room where anyone would normally sit is a cupboard with a shelf full of junk. After K. leaves, he meets up with Josef Huld who tries to get him to explain what's happened. He explains that he is very ill and needs to leave the city immediately. He also says that he will be returning to the country soon so they can begin their legal work again. But before he can finish this sentence, an old friend of K.s uncle comes into the office saying that something terrible has happened. This makes K. even more dispirited. The Lawyer-Manufacturer K. begins work on a written defense of his business case. He is tired from all the hard work in the past few months and has no idea how to prepare documents for publication. His uncle rushes out of the building, leaving K. alone with the law clerk's uncle. The day after the trial comes when he receives a visit from Mr. Lawrence, an important client who wants to see K. legal advice. After learning more about K.s background and having been involved in some shady business dealings, Dr. Lawrence tells K. not to worry--he will be back by Christmas. K. tries to keep the attention of the other two men, but this only makes him more anxious. The manufacturer comes in and tells K. his business is going well. He also mentions that he knows about K.'s lawsuit against the bank through a painter who lives nearby. This paints K. into a deep emotional depression because he realizes how much influence the court system has on him. In order to help K. avoid being labeled as an ""irregular"" person or someone else , K. asks the painter if he might be interested in helping him get out of jail. The painting does indeed have a name--it's called 'Godof the Hunt' . K. finds himself surrounded by three beautiful young girls who want to talk to him while he is doing his work. K. hides behind a bed in order to avoid being discovered by the other artisans. The girls tease him about this and he curses them as they move around the room. He takes off his jacket and puts it over his knee before continuing on with his work. A painter named K. shows him a picture of a moors-landscape landscape, explaining that it is exactly like the one K. is currently working on. After K. leaves, another painter named ""Block"" asks K. if he would like to buy some paintings from him. When K. says no, Block offers to take K. to see an important lawyer who will represent him in his criminal case. This lawyer's name is Mr. Donnithorne; K. wants to hear more about his case so he agrees to meet the businessman there. K. tells the businessman that if he continues to represent K. in Huld's court case, it will be the very first time anyone has asked him to help with the case. The businessman explains that this is because Judge Huld likes to see ""the accused"" . K. then announces that he intends to leave his representation of Huld and move to a different part of the city where he can work as a legal adviser. He also says that he no longer plans on continuing to represent Mr. K., but will instead go to see an important Italian Business Consultant at the Cathedral. This Italian man is K.'s deputy director who accompanies K. during the trip. After K. leaves the office, the Spanish-speaking man follows K. around the cathedral looking for some way to communicate with the other Italians. K. arrives at the prison and is greeted by a priest who asks him to come with him to see K. He has been accused of spying on a man from Italy, and it turns out that this man was the jail chaplain assigned to escort K. To K.'s surprise, he finds himself in the middle of a long line of men waiting to enter the prison. The priests ask K. if he will be willing to let them in; K. says no, but they agree to allow him into the prison when he pleads for it. After K. leaves, two men come to visit him. They take his belongings and place him in a well-preserved spot near a rockface. Then they perform a ritual whereby they twist his neck and twist his heart so that the result is ""like a dog."" advertisement",8.123280809298949,0.30530164035324814
Pride and Prejudice," The narrative opens with Mr Bingley, a wealthy, charming and social young bachelor, moving into Netherfield Park in the neighbourhood of the Bennet family. Mr Bingley is soon well received, while his friend Mr Darcy makes a less favorable first impression by appearing proud and condescending at a ball that they attend (this is partly explained in that he detests dancing and is not much for light conversation). Mr Bingley singles out Elizabeth's elder sister, Jane, for particular attention, and it soon becomes apparent that they have formed an attachment to each other. By contrast, Darcy slights Elizabeth, who overhears and jokes about it despite feeling a budding resentment. On paying a visit to Mr Bingley's sister, Jane is caught in a heavy downpour, catches cold, and is forced to stay at Netherfield for several days. Elizabeth arrives to nurse her sister and is thrown into frequent company with Mr Darcy, who begins to perceive his attachment to her, but is too proud to proceed on this feeling. Mr Collins, a clergyman, pays a visit to the Bennets. Mr Bennet and Elizabeth are much amused by his obsequious veneration of his employer, the noble Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as well as by his self-important and pedantic nature. It soon becomes apparent that Mr Collins has come to Longbourn to choose a wife from among the Bennet sisters (his cousins) and Elizabeth has been singled out. At the same time, Elizabeth forms an acquaintance with Mr Wickham, a militia officer who claims to have been very seriously mistreated by Mr Darcy, despite having been a ward of Mr Darcy's father. This tale, and Elizabeth's attraction to Mr Wickham, adds fuel to her dislike of Mr Darcy. At a ball given by Mr Bingley at Netherfield, Mr Darcy becomes aware of a general expectation that Mr Bingley and Jane will marry, and the Bennet family, with the exception of Jane and Elizabeth, make a public display of poor manners and decorum. The following morning, Mr Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth, who refuses him, much to her mother's distress. Mr Collins recovers and promptly becomes engaged to Elizabeth's close friend Charlotte, a homely woman with few prospects. Mr Bingley abruptly quits Netherfield and returns to London, and Elizabeth is convinced that Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley's sister have conspired to separate him from Jane. In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are frequently invited to Rosings Park, home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy's aunt; coincidentally, Darcy also arrives to visit. Darcy again finds himself attracted to Elizabeth and impetuously proposes to her. Elizabeth, however, has just learned of Darcy's role in separating Mr Bingley from Jane from his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam. She angrily rebukes him, and a heated discussion follows; she charges him with destroying her sister's happiness, with treating Mr Wickham disgracefully, and with having conducted himself towards her in an ungentleman-like manner. Mr Darcy, shocked, ultimately responds with a letter giving a good account of (most of) his actions: Wickham had exchanged his legacies for a cash payment, only to return after gambling away the money to reclaim the forfeited inheritance; he then attempted to elope with Darcy's young sister, thereby to capture her fortune. Regarding Mr Bingley and Jane, Darcy claimed he had observed no reciprocal interest in Jane for Bingley. Elizabeth later came to acknowledge the truth of Darcy's assertions. Some months later, Elizabeth and her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate, believing he will be absent for the day. He returns unexpectedly, and though surprised, he is gracious and welcoming. He treats the Gardiners with great civility; he introduces Elizabeth to his sister, and Elizabeth begins to realise her attraction to him. Their reacquaintance is cut short, however, by news that Lydia, Elizabeth's sister, has run away to elope with Mr Wickham. Elizabeth and the Gardiners return to Longbourn, where Elizabeth grieves that her renewed acquaintance with Mr Darcy will end because of her sister's disgrace. Lydia and Wickham are soon found, then married by the clergy; they visit Longbourn, where Lydia lets slip that Mr Darcy was responsible for finding the couple and negotiating their marriage—at great expense to himself. Elizabeth is shocked but does not dwell further on the topic due to Mr Bingley's return and subsequent proposal to Jane, who immediately accepts. Lady Catherine de Bourgh later bursts in on Longbourn; intending to thwart local rumour, she warns Elizabeth against marrying Mr Darcy. Elizabeth refuses her demands. Disgusted, Lady Catherine leaves and drops by to inform her nephew on Elizabeth's abominable behaviour. However, this lends hope to Darcy that Elizabeth's opinion of him may have changed. He travels to Longbourn and proposes again; and now Elizabeth accepts.
","Jane Austen's novels are well-known throughout England, but few of them rank among the best in the genre. For instance, Jane Austens most recent novel, Pride and Pjudice, was published in 1796; it was not until 1813 that she died. The main plot is based on a minor incident at Bingley's courtship of Lydia Fitzwilliams sister, Miss Bates. There are other minor plot developments as well, like Darcy stealing Fanny from Mrs. Bulstrode and Elizabeth refusing to marry Wickham because he is too vain for her liking. Finally, there is Darcy who has come to Netherfield only to have his sisters introduce him to some of their beautiful young ladies. He does not seem to be interested in any of these women, though they do make an impression upon him. Darcy has resumed his interest in Jane, but this time he is even more interested in her because of Bingley's admiration and the fact that Darcy does not seem to like her very much. Elizabeth begins to suspect that she is also beginning to show a preference for Darcy by the way she talks to him about her. Charlotte points out that there may be some romance between these two young women, but they do not want it to develop into a romance. The Bennet household soon returns to Netherfields, where Mrs. Bennett continues to insist on having a ball there. During the party, Miss Betsey notices that Jane is getting closer to being sick. She asks Bingley if she can go see her sister while she recovers from her illness. When Elizabeth arrives home, she finds all four of her sisters waiting for her. They tell her that she will have to travel three miles to meet her sister when she gets better. Darcy and Elizabeth spend most of their evening together at the drawing room, where they are introduced to a gentleman named Willimo Collins. Collins reveals that he has been invited by Mr. Bennett to serve in the army as a lieutenant colonel. He also announces that he plans to marry one of Elizabeth Bennet's daughters, whom he dislikes because of her low birth and lack of education. Elizabeth is particularly enamored with his attentions to her. Elizabeth and Wickham continue their conversation, with Wickham telling Elizabeth that he is glad to see the Bennets are getting married. He also tells her about his mother, who died when Wickham was a young boy. After this chapter ends, Elizabeth relates to Jane what she has learned from Darcy regarding Wickhams absence. She says that there have been many misunderstandings between Darcy and Elizabeth because they do not share the same social circle as other members of the Bennett family. The next morning, Collins announces that he will be away for only a few weeks. This news troubles Elizabeth greatly, but she manages to keep her spirits up through the remainder of the night. During the following week, Bingley invites the entire Bennett family to Netherfield for a ball on Tuesday evening. When Elizabeth arrives home, she finds Mrs. Bennett alone with her youngest daughter, Kitty. As soon as Elizabeth leaves, Darcy asks her why she does not introduce herself to him sooner. Elizabeth responds by saying that she wants to find a more suitable woman. Mr. Collins tells Elizabeth that he is going to propose marriage to her soon, but that she should not accept until after her mother dies. He also says that he would rather have Charlotte Lucas as a companion than marry someone else. Elizabeth refuses his offer and continues refusing him. When the Bennets return from their honeymoon, they learn that all of the members of the Bennett family are leaving Netherfield for London in the winter. The following day, Jane receives a letter from Caroline Bingleys daughter, asking her to reconsider her refusal. She does so reluctantly, and when Mr. Martin Bingley returns home, he makes it clear that he has decided to marry her. Elizabeth continues to question Mr. Bennett about Darcy and his sisters, but they do not mention Bingley or Darcy in their conversation with Elizabeth. The next time Elizabeth mentions Darcy again, she says that her sisters only wish that he marry someone of high class. They do not want him to become a rich man, so they will keep him away from Jane. After the Bennets return home, Charlotte and Elizabeth spend Christmas at Netherfield. During this visit, Lady Catherine invites them over for tea and dinner. She tells Elizabeth that Wickham is now interested in another woman. Elizabeth also learns that Maria Lucas has been invited to join the Hursts on their honeymoon. Sir William returns to London for a week, and while he is away, Elizabeth visits Rosings with the Collins family. While there, she sees Darcy again, this time visiting his sister in her parsonage instead of staying at her aunt Lady Catherine's house. During their visit, Elizabeth learns that Darcy intends to propose marriage to Elizabeth. She does not want to hear it, so she asks Darcy why he has made such an effort to separate Jane and Bingley; Darcy responds by saying that he did not have much affection for Jane but admired her nonetheless. Elizabeth also learns that when Darcy calls on them every morning, they are accompanied by Mrs.Collins, who is very concerned about what will become of Wickhams affections towards Elizabeth. The next day, Elizabeth receives a letter from Darcy asking her to reconsider her decision to leave Netherfield. He explains that he disapproves of all ties between Jane and Darcy as being caused by vanity rather than due to pride. In addition, he blames himself for ruining the fortunes of both Jane and Sir William. Darcy leaves for London immediately, leaving Elizabeth and Bingley in charge of his mother's estate. He returns to the city on the same day that he leaves Netherfield; they spend the next three years together studying law and preparing for their upcoming trip to Brighton. During this time, Jane is left to care for her younger sister, Maria, and Darcy while Elizabeth spends most of her time with Mr. Bennett. The Bennet family receives a letter from Darcy saying that he must not stay in London as much longer than expected due to the growing number of young people in the neighborhood who are interested in Wickhams activities. Elizabeth has no idea what the letter says about Wickham until she reads it over and over again. She realizes that there is still something hidden behind the deception. Lydia invites Mr. Bennett to Brighton for a visit, and he tells her that she should not worry about going there as it will only make her more attractive to other men. Elizabeth is disappointed by this news, but soon finds out that Darcy has come to visit the family in order to see them while they are away. Lydia also receives an invitation back from one of her dear friends, who asks her to go with them to Brighton on the northern tour. They arrive just before their scheduled departure time, and upon returning home, Elizabeth sees Darcy again. This time, though, his attention is focused on Elizabeth rather than on him. He compliments her on how well Darcy looks and acts, which surprises Elizabeth because she had expected him to do such a thing. When they return home, both Jane and Elizabeth are shocked to find that Darce now lives next door to theirs. Elizabeth immediately feels discomfited at being introduced to Darcy; after all, what kind of man does Darcy live up to his name? Darcy and Bingley arrive, and Elizabeth is quite surprised to see how embarrassed she is by their arrival. She begins to wonder why Darcy looks so much like Jane when he has no apparent interest in her at all. They soon learn that they must leave for London immediately because of a trip to Scotland on the scheduled fishing trip. Elizabeth also wonders if Wickham may have eloped with Lydia while she was still in Brighton. Elizabeth tells her aunt and uncle that she has just received a letter informing her that Mrs. Goddard and Wickham are leaving for Scotland as planned. The Gardiners tell Elizabeth that Mr. Fitzhugh will be returning from London very shortly. Elizabeth hopes that there will be some news about Wickham soon, but it is too late. The Bennet family receives a letter informing them that Wickhaber and Lydia have eloped. The Bennets are now without their daughter for two weeks, due to the financial ruin caused by the gambling debts they incurred while traveling in London. Elizabeth is extremely distressed at the loss of her only daughter; Jane is even more distressed when she hears about Wickhams disgraceful behavior towards Lydia. Mrs . Bennet also receives a similar letter from Wickham stating that he intends to marry Lydia. This news causes much rejoicing among the Bennets, who are all very pleased with the marriage Elizabeth receives a letter from her aunt telling her of the events of the previous week. She is shocked to learn that Darcy has been at Bingley and Jane Bennet's wedding, but she also realizes that he must have had some ulterior motive in helping them arrange the marriage. When Darcy visits Netherfield again, Elizabeth finds out that there is indeed a gentleman accompanying Bingley on his return trip to London. Although Elizabeth does not wish to see this gentleman, she hopes that he will come to visit soon so that they can discuss the matter further. Bingley and Elizabeth are pleased that they have finally solved the mystery of Darcy and Elizabeth. They also rejoice in the fact that Bingley now has more money than he ever had before. One morning Lady Catherine comes to visit them. She tells Elizabeth that her sister Jane is engaged, and says that she will not accept Darcy because his aunt does not want him to do so. Elizabeth realizes that this means that she cannot marry Darcy until Darcy agrees to marry her. advertisement",2.4777380547477583,0.2629904511483286
A Tale of Two Cities," Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Lucie Manette travel to Saint Antoine, a suburb of Paris, and meet Monsieur Defarge and Madame Defarge. The Defarges operate a wine shop they use to lead a clandestine band of revolutionaries; they refer to each other by the codename ""Jacques,"" which Charles Dickens drew from the Jacobins, an actual French revolutionary group. Monsieur Defarge was Doctor Manette's servant before his incarceration, and now takes care of him, so he takes them to see the doctor. Because of his long imprisonment, Doctor Manette entered a form of psychosis and has become obsessed with making shoes, a trade he had learned while in prison. At first, he does not recognise his daughter; but he eventually compares her long golden hair with her mother's, a strand of which he found on his sleeve when he was incarcerated and kept, and notices their identical blue eye colour. Mr. Lorry and Miss Manette then take him back to England. Five years later, two British spies, John Barsad and Roger Cly, are trying to frame French émigré Charles Darnay for their own gain; and Darnay is on trial for treason at the Old Bailey. They claim, falsely, that Darnay gave information about British troops in North America to the French. Darnay is acquitted, however, when a witness who claims he would be able to recognise Darnay anywhere is unable to tell Darnay apart from a barrister present in court, Sydney Carton, who looks almost identical to him. In Paris, a wheel on the despised Marquis St. Evrémonde's carriage hits and kills the baby of a peasant, Gaspard. The Marquis throws a coin to Gaspard to compensate him for his loss. Defarge, a witness to the incident, comforts Gaspard. As the Marquis's coach drives off, the coin thrown to Gaspard is thrown back into the coach by an unknown hand, probably that of Madame Defarge, enraging the Marquis. Arriving at his château, the Marquis meets with his nephew and heir, Darnay. (Out of disgust with his family, Darnay shed his real surname and adopted an Anglicised version of his mother's maiden name, D'Aulnais.) The following scene demonstrates the differences between Darnay's personality and his uncle's: Darnay has sympathy for the peasantry, while the Marquis is cruel and heartless: ""Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,"" observed the Marquis, ""will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,"" looking up to it, ""shuts out the sky."" That night, Gaspard, who followed the Marquis to his château by riding on the underside of the carriage, stabs and kills the Marquis in his sleep. He leaves a note on the knife saying, &#34;Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from JACQUES.&#34; After nine months on the run, he is caught, and hanged above the village&#39;s fountain, poisoning its water, which angers the peasants greatly. In London, Darnay gets Dr. Manette&#39;s permission to wed Lucie; but Carton confesses his love to Lucie as well. Knowing she will not love him in return, Carton promises to &#34;embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you&#34;. On the morning of the marriage, Darnay reveals his real name and who his family is, a detail which Dr. Manette had asked him to withhold until then. This unhinges Dr. Manette, who reverts to his obsessive shoemaking. His sanity is restored before Lucie returns from her honeymoon and the whole incident kept secret from her. To prevent a further relapse, Lorry and Miss Pross destroy the shoemaking bench and tools, which Dr. Manette had brought with him from Paris. It is 14 July 1789. The Defarges help to lead the storming of the Bastille. Defarge enters Dr. Manette&#39;s former cell, &#34;One Hundred and Five, North Tower&#34;. The reader does not know what Monsieur Defarge is searching for until Book 3, Chapter 9. It is a statement in which Dr. Manette explains why he was imprisoned. As time passes in England, Lucie and Charles begin to raise a family, a son (who dies in childhood) and a daughter, little Lucie. The perennial bachelor Lorry, who believes that such things are beyond &#34;a man of business&#34;, finds a second home and a sort of family with the Darnays. Stryver, who once had intentions to marry Lucie, marries a rich widow with three children and becomes even more insufferable as his ambitions begin to be realised. Carton, even though he seldom visits, is accepted as a close friend of the family and becomes a special favourite of little Lucie. Darnay, being called by a former servant who has been unjustly imprisoned, decides to come back to France to free him. But shortly after his arrival, he is denounced for being an emigrated aristocrat from France and imprisoned in La Force Prison in Paris. Dr. Manette and Lucie—along with Miss Pross, Jerry Cruncher, and &#34;Little Lucie&#34;, the daughter of Charles and Lucie Darnay—come to Paris and meet Mr. Lorry to try to free Darnay. A year and three months pass, and Darnay is finally tried. Dr. Manette, who is seen as a hero for his imprisonment in the hated Bastille, is able to have him released; but, that same evening, Darnay is again arrested. He is put on trial again the following day, under new charges brought by the Defarges and one &#34;unnamed other&#34;. We soon discover that this &#34;other&#34; is Dr. Manette, through his own account of his imprisonment. Manette did not know that his statement had been found and is horrified when his words are used to condemn Darnay. On an errand, Miss Pross is amazed to see her long-lost brother, Solomon Pross; but Solomon does not want to be recognised. Sydney Carton suddenly steps forward from the shadows much as he had done after Darnay&#39;s first trial in London and identifies Solomon Pross as John Barsad, one of the men who tried to frame Darnay for treason at the Old Bailey trial. Carton threatens to reveal Solomon&#39;s identity as a Briton and an opportunist who spies for the French or the British as it suits him. If this were revealed, Solomon would surely be executed, so Carton&#39;s hand is strong. Darnay is confronted at the tribunal by Monsieur Defarge, who identifies Darnay as the Marquis St. Evrémonde and reads the letter Dr. Manette had hidden in his cell in the Bastille. Defarge can identify Darnay as Evrémonde because Barsad told him Darnay&#39;s identity when Barsad was fishing for information at the Defarges&#39; wine shop in Book 2, Chapter 16. The letter describes how Dr. Manette was locked away in the Bastille by Darnay&#39;s father and his uncle for trying to report their crimes against a peasant family. Darnay&#39;s uncle had become infatuated with a girl, whom he had kidnapped and raped. Despite Dr. Manette&#39;s attempts to save her, she died. The uncle then killed her husband by working him to death. Before he died defending the family honour, the brother of the raped peasant had hidden the last member of the family, his younger sister. The letter also reveals that Dr. Manette was imprisoned because the Evrémonde brothers discovered that they could not bribe him to keep quiet. The paper concludes by condemning the Evrémondes, &#34;them and their descendants, to the last of their race&#34;. Dr. Manette is horrified, but his protests are ignored—he is not allowed to take back his condemnation. Darnay is sent to the Conciergerie and sentenced to be guillotined the next day. Carton wanders into the Defarges&#39; wine shop, where he overhears Madame Defarge talking about her plans to have the rest of Darnay&#39;s family (Lucie and &#34;Little Lucie&#34;) condemned. Carton discovers that Madame Defarge was the surviving sister of the peasant family savaged by the Evrémondes. The only plot detail that might give one any sympathy for Madame Defarge is the loss of her family and that she has no (family) name. Defarge is her married name, and Dr. Manette does not know her family name, though he asked her dying sister for it. At night, when Dr. Manette returns shattered after spending the day in many failed attempts to save Charles&#39; life, he has reverted to his obsessive search for his shoemaking implements. Carton urges Lorry to flee Paris with Lucie, her father, and Little Lucie, &#34;as soon as his, i.e Carton&#39;s place in the coach is filled&#34;. That same morning, Carton visits Darnay in prison. Carton drugs Darnay, and Barsad (whom Carton is blackmailing) has Darnay carried out of the prison. Carton has decided to pretend to be Darnay and to be executed in his place. He does this out of love for Lucie, recalling his earlier promise to her. Following Carton&#39;s earlier instructions, Darnay&#39;s family and Lorry flee Paris and France. In their coach is an unconscious man who carries Carton&#39;s identification papers, but is actually Darnay. Meanwhile, Madame Defarge, armed with a pistol, goes to the residence of Lucie&#39;s family, hoping to catch them mourning for Darnay, since it was illegal to mourn an enemy of the Republic; however, Lucie and Little Lucie, Dr. Manette, and Mr. Lorry are already gone. To give them time to escape, Miss Pross confronts Madame Defarge and they struggle. Pross speaks only English and Defarge speaks only French, so neither can understand what the other is saying but each instinctively understands the other&#39;s intentions. In the struggle, Madame Defarge&#39;s pistol goes off, killing her; the noise of the shot and the shock of Madame Defarge&#39;s death cause Miss Pross to go permanently deaf. The novel concludes with the guillotining of Sydney Carton. As he is waiting to board the tumbril, he is approached by a seamstress, also condemned to death, who mistakes him for Darnay but, upon getting close, realises the truth. Awed by his unselfish courage and sacrifice, she asks to stay close to him and he agrees. Upon their arrival at the guillotine, she and Carton are the last two and Carton comforts her, telling her that their ends will be quick but that there is no Time or Trouble &#34;in the better land where ... [they] will be mercifully sheltered&#34;, and she is able to meet her death in peace. Carton&#39;s unspoken last thoughts are prophetic: ""I see Barsad, ... Defarge, The Vengeance [a lieutenant of Madame Defarge], ... long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out. &#34;I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man [Mr. Lorry], so long their friend, in ten years&#39; time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward. ""I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul, than I was in the souls of both. &#34;I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place—then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day&#39;s disfigurement—and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice. ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."" Lucie and Darnay have a first son earlier in the book who is born and dies within a single paragraph; it seems likely that this first son appears in the novel so that their later son, named after Carton, can represent another way in which Carton restores Lucie and Darnay through his sacrifice.
","The Dover Mail The Dover Mail travels from London to Paris in November of 1775. It stops at Shooter's Hill, the main resting place for the Dover Express. A messenger arrives and tells the passengers that he is going to Dover to retrieve a message from Mr. Lucie Manette who has just been buried alive. He asks if she would like to accompany him on his trip to France. She does not want to do anything but wait until he gets her there. After the messenger departs, Lorry goes to see Miss M. Manette whom he calls ""Mam'selle"" because she looks so disheartened by the question. She responds by saying that she hopes he will be able to help her father find his way back to England after eighteen years of captivity. The Golden Thread Five years later, the scene shifts to a street in Paris. A red wine has been spilled upon the ground by a crowd of people who have been grumbling about their lack of food and shelter. There are also signs of Want on the streets around Paris that remind one or more of the French famine of 1775. The narrator notes that this is the fifth book in the Golden Thread. In Chapter I, the narrator describes the situation in Tellson's Bank, a small, dark, cramped, and generally unpleasant establishment owned by Mr. and Mrs. Defarges, known as ""the Keepers of the House."" As they enter the shop, Monserrat Manette emerges from behind a closed door. He looks very disheveled; his face is sunken, his voice is pitch-dark, and there is a faint odor of decay everywhere. His white beard grows shorter than it used to be, and before long he had become an old, worn man with a habit of clinging onto everything except his own shoemaker's knife. When Lucie Manette approaches him, she asks him if he will be able to see her father. He replies that he will not, for fear of being discovered. She then takes possession of his hand and kisses it. Darnay is brought before the court and sentenced to death for his part in a scheme to aid Louisa May Alcott's enemy, the Jacobite French King. The prosecution asks that he be allowed to remain in the courtroom during the trial so that they may question him further about his role in the conspiracy. He pleads with the judge not to allow him to do so, but the judge refuses to let him go because of his nervousness. Meanwhile, Carton appears on the stand and tells the court that Darnays testimony will incriminate him if he is found guilty. As Carton leaves the courtroom, the Attorney General calls upon Dr. Manette and Doctor Alexandre Lorry to testify as witnesses. They also call Roger Cly who has been present throughout the entire trial. When asked by the Judge why he was unable to give testimony at the beginning of the trial, however brief, he replies that he cannot answer any of the questions given to him by the judge. After Carton leaves, the two of them go to dinner and wine at a local tavern. Afterward, they drink some more wine before Carton asks if he likes him. He replies that he does not like anyone else but himself. They talk for a long time about Carton's drinking habits and then retire to their respective rooms in the Parisian Grand Hotel. The narrator notes that Lucie is very fond of her father-in-law, Dr. Manette; she also has a close relationship with Doctor Alexandre Manette whom she calls ""the Old Sydney Cartons."" Mr. Laurence Lorry arrives at the Manette home one Sunday afternoon after dineing with the Manettes. As usual, there is no one there. A storm rages outside, and people begin to gather inside the hotel. There seems to be an odd mix of good and evil going on in this part of France. The Marquis drives his carriage through the streets of Paris, draping himself over and over again in front of a crowd of poor peasants. He stops at a graveyard where a man with a gun has thrown a bundle of dirt from the horses onto the street below. The man who threw the dirt is identified as Defarge, a peddler of wine whose name is also known as Gaspards. Afterward, Darnays uncle tells him that he cannot marry Lucie because she will not be able to bear the burden of her father's death. Inevitably, the old man dies. Meanwhile, Charles receives a letter from Jacques, assuring him that there is still hope for Lucie. Darnay makes a promise to Lucie that if she ever tells him that she loves him, he will tell her the truth on her wedding morning. She does not want to hear any more details about his past or his current name, but rather asks for a promise that if anything should ever happen between them, they will bear witness to what he has said and assure no influence over her future happiness. The following chapter is a companion picture of Dr. Manette's drunken stupefaction as he prepares to leave for his honeymoon. He begins by saying that he intends to marry Lucie before he leaves town. Later that same night, Strayver goes to Tellson's Bank in order to make arrangements with Lucie. While there, he sees two men whom he calls ""The Honest Tradersman."" They are one man , the other a young man , who identifies himself as Roger Cly, an old Bailey spy whose deathbed was attended by a crowd of mournful mourners. After this incident, Carton becomes involved in a long-winded conversation which ends in tears. On the third day of his visit to Defarge's wine shop, a man named Jacques is discovered hanging by an iron gate outside the shop. The man explains that he has been traveling with one of those hired men who used to be the road mender in St. Antoine. He describes the scene as ""immaculate and full of dust"" . After Jacques departs, Madame Darge tells Defarge that her husband is to marry Lucie the next day. She also reveals that another spy has been assigned to the area to find out more about the whereabouts of this mysterious man. Dr. Manette tells Lucie that if only she had never met Charles, her father. He then goes on to talk about the years that have passed since he was released from prison and how he has looked at his daughter's life in terms of her innocence and love. They are married and leave for their honeymoon. The wedding day is bright and dappled, but Doctor Alexandre Manette remains pale and unresponsive. After the wedding, Dr. Manettes and Miss Pss take him to Tellson's where he will be taken care of during his next fortnight of visit to Wales. Meanwhile, Lucies husband and daughter go off to church together. Later that day, Dagnay and Manette meet up with Carton who reveals that he too has been suffering from a mental breakdown. This revelation upsets both Manette and Lorry as well as makes them more concerned about whether or not this relapse will occur again. Meanwhile, in Paris, the revolutionaries attack the Evremondes. They start with a loud cry for help from Defarge's wine shop and then move on to the notorious North Tower, which is located near the famous St. Antoine fountain. The revolutionaries set fire to the building but manage to put out the blaze without anyone noticing. Meanwhile, the French Revolution has destroyed much of the social order that had made life so comfortable in France. Many of the aristocrats have fled or are planning to flee. One such exile is Monsieure St.Evremonde, who has been imprisoned for telling the peasants that they should eat grass instead of wheat. He dies by strangulation at the hands of an unidentified hand. A man named Jacques comes upon him one day and asks if he can see his face. When Jacques does not answer, the man tells him that it is Mr. Soderbergh whom he calls ""D-n-the-he-you-so"" . This makes Jacques even more determined to destroy the Marquises name. Darnay writes two letters explaining his impending arrival in Paris and telling Lucie that he has been imprisoned for acting against the interests of the French people. The first letter is addressed to Gabellle, explaining that he will be sentenced to death if he succeeds in escaping from prison. The second letter is written to Doctor Alexandre Manette informing him that he is being sent on a trip to Paris under the charge of Evremonde. He arrives in Paris very late at night and receives a letter from Dr. Manette expressing his desire to return home as quickly as possible. After much deliberation, it is decided that Darnays departure must take place immediately. On August 31st, after an exhausting day of travel, he reaches Paris. There he finds Lucie along with her father. A crowd gathers to greet them. They all disperse when they arrive at the Grand-Guilbert Prison, which serves as a sort of jail cell for prisoners who have escaped from France. Defarges wife and daughter rush into the room but are prevented from entering the prison by their captors. When Mr. Damette leaves, Defarge appears and tells Lorry what has happened. Darnay receives a note from Lucie asking him to kiss her daughter for her father. He does so, and The Vengeance arrives with the same news: eleven hundred people have been killed in the unrestrained streets of Paris. Dr. Manette is appointed as the inspecting doctor of three French prisons. Meanwhile, Doctor Alexandre Lorry has become the official physician of one La Force prison. In December, he presides over two years of rapid change in France. A new era begins; the King is tried, imprisoned, and hanged. Thousands of prisoners are condemned to death each year. Many of those condemned by the Republic are exiled or die on the gallows. One such exile is Charles Evremmonde , who is accused of being an enemy to Spain. His trial is scheduled for next week. Sydney Carton shows up at the trial. He tells Carton that he has been made a prisoner again, this time by the Defarge and one other person who is also an official of the Insolvent French Republic. Sydney asks Carton if he can speak to Solomon about his new position in the prison. The two men go off to have a private chat with each other. They find out that Solomon works as a messenger for Dr. Manette's company. When Carton goes back to tell him what happened, he finds Jerry Crunchers old friend from the Darnays trial. After Carton departs, Lorry sees Carton sitting next to Doctor Alexandre Manette whom Carton had befriended when Carton first arrived in Paris. In their conversation, they both realize that Carton will not be able to defend himself against Barsad or Lucie. However, after Carton leaves, Cartons father-son conversation takes on a decidedly different tone than it did before. In Chapter X, Manette explains that he has written a letter to the President of France in which he states that he will answer for the names of his clients and their deaths. He then instructs one of his conductors to open a chimney and place a piece of paper on top of it. The note is inscribed with the letters A, B, C, D, E . In Chapter XI, Cartons notes that two men--a young man and a young woman named Lucie--are present when he arrives at Dr. Manette's cell. They are Doctor Alexandre Defarge and Charles Defarge; they are also present when Carton arrives. After receiving the news that Lucie is dying, she tells him that her husband and father have been forced out of their cottage by Evremonde brothers. She says that she would like to see them put to death so that no one can take advantage of them. Later that night, Cartoons sees Lucie pass him by while he is walking down the street. When he looks up, there is nothing but blood on his face: ""I saw what you did, sir. I said goodbye to my dear daughter."" Carton and Lorry discuss Carton's status in prison. They decide that Lucie must leave Paris immediately to avoid being denounced as a prisoner of the guillotine, or else she will be condemned to death herself. Meanwhile, Doctor Alexandre Manette receives a letter from Lucie informing him that he has been granted permission to travel with her and her family to France. He also gives Dr. Manette a certificate enabling him to leave Paris at anytime. Before they leave for England, however, Catherines son-in-law urges Carton to tell Lucie that it is her duty to take care of their sick father and daughter. As Carton prepares to board the train bound for Marseille, Madame Pross appears on the scene. She attempts to communicate through gestures and by means of a litany of coded language. When she realizes what she is doing, she calls out to Monsieur de Lorry and tells him to follow her. A few moments later, when Mme. Defarge arrives, she reveals herself as Lucie's widowed mother. The women are taken into a waiting coach headed for Evremonde. advertisement",4.855025155796016,0.3076030129969695
Oblomov," The novel evolved and expanded from an 1849 short story or sketch entitled ""Oblomov's Dream. An Episode from an Unfinished Novel"", later incorporated as ""Oblomov's Dream"" (""Son Oblomova"") as Chapter 9 in the completed 1859 novel. The novel focuses on the midlife crisis of the main character, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, an upper middle class son of a member of Russia's nineteenth century landed gentry. Oblomov's distinguishing characteristic is his slothful attitude towards life. While a common negative characteristic, Oblomov raises this trait to an art form, conducting his little daily business apathetically from his bed. While clearly comedic, the novel also seriously examines many critical issues that faced Russian society in the nineteenth century. Some of these problems included the uselessness of landowners and gentry in a feudal society that did not encourage innovation or reform, the complex relations between members of different classes of society such as Oblomov's relationship with his servant Zakhar, and courtship and matrimony by the elite. An excerpt from Oblomov's morning (from the beginning of the novel): :Therefore he did as he had decided; and when the tea had been consumed he raised himself upon his elbow and arrived within an ace of getting out of bed. In fact, glancing at his slippers, he even began to extend a foot in their direction, but presently withdrew it. :Half-past ten struck, and Oblomov gave himself a shake. ""What is the matter?,"" he said vexedly. ""In all conscience 'tis time that I were doing something! Would I could make up my mind to—to—"" He broke off with a shout of ""Zakhar!"" whereupon there entered an elderly man in a grey suit and brass buttons—a man who sported beneath a perfectly bald pate a pair of long, bushy, grizzled whiskers that would have sufficed to fit out three ordinary men with beards. His clothes, it is true, were cut according to a country pattern, but he cherished them as a faint reminder of his former livery, as the one surviving token of the dignity of the house of Oblomov. The house of Oblomov was one which had once been wealthy and distinguished, but which, of late years, had undergone impoverishment and diminution, until finally it had become lost among a crowd of noble houses of more recent creation. :For a few moments Oblomov remained too plunged in thought to notice Zakhar's presence; but at length the valet coughed. :""What do you want?"" Oblomov inquired. :""You called me just now, master?"" :""I called you, you say? Well, I cannot remember why I did so. Return to your room until I have remembered."" Oblomov spends the first part of the book in bed or lying on his sofa. He receives a letter from the manager of his country estate explaining that the financial situation is deteriorating and that he must visit the estate to make some major decisions, but Oblomov can barely leave his bedroom, much less journey a thousand miles into the country. A flashback reveals a good deal of why Oblomov is so slothful; the reader sees Oblomov's upbringing in the country village of Oblomovka. He is spoiled rotten and never required to work or perform household duties, and he is constantly pulled from school for vacations and trips or for trivial reasons. In contrast, his friend Andrey Stoltz, born to a German father and a Russian mother, is raised in a strict, disciplined environment, reflecting Goncharov's own view of the European mentality as dedicated and hard-working. As the story develops, Stoltz introduces Oblomov to a young woman, Olga, and the two fall in love. However, his apathy and fear of moving forward are too great, and she calls off their engagement when it is clear that he will keep delaying their wedding to avoid having to take basic steps like putting his affairs in order. :""Shall I tell you what you would have done had we married?"" at length she said. ""Day by day you would have relapsed farther and farther into your slough. And I? You see what I am—that I am not yet grown old, and that I shall never cease to live. But you would have taken to waiting for Christmas, and then for Shrovetide, and to attending evening parties, and to dancing, and to thinking of nothing at all. You would have retired to rest each night with a sigh of thankfulness that the day had passed so quickly; and each morning you would have awakened with a prayer that to-day might be exactly as yesterday. That would have been our future. Is it not so? Meanwhile I should have been fading away. Do you really think that in such a life you would have been happy?"" :He tried to rise and leave the room, but his feet refused their office. He tried to say something, but his throat seemed dry, and no sound would come. All he could do was to stretch out his hand. :""Forgive me!"" he murmured. :She too tried to speak, but could not. She too tried to extend her hand, but it fell back. Finally, her face contracted painfully, and, sinking forward upon his shoulder, she burst into a storm of sobbing. It was as though all her weapons had slipped from her grasp, and once more she was just a woman—a woman defenceless in her fight with sorrow. :""Good-bye, good-bye!"" she said amid her spasms of weeping. He sat listening painfully to her sobs, but felt as though he could say nothing to check them. Sinking into a chair, and burying her face in her handkerchief, she wept bitter, burning tears, with her head bowed upon the table. :""Olga,"" at length he said, ""why torture yourself in this way? You love me, and could never survive a parting. Take me, therefore, as I am, and love in me just so much as may be worthy of it."" :Without raising her head, she made a gesture of refusal. During this period, Oblomov is swindled repeatedly by his ""friend"" Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich, his landlady's brother, and Stoltz has to undo the damage each time. The last time, Oblomov ends up living in penury because Taranteyev and Ivan Matveyevich are blackmailing him out of all of his income from the country estate, which lasts for over a year before Stoltz discovers the situation and reports Ivan Matveyevich to his supervisor. Olga leaves Russia and visits Paris, where she bumps into Stoltz on the street. The two strike up a romance and end up marrying. However, not even Oblomov could go through life without at least one moment of self-possession and purpose. When Taranteyev's behavior at last reaches insufferable lows, Oblomov confronts him, slaps him around a bit and finally kicks him out of the house, in a scene in which all the noble traits that his social class was supposed to symbolize shine through his then worn out being. Oblomov has a child with his widowed landlady, Agafia Pshenitsina, but they never marry. They name the child Andrey, after Stoltz, who adopts the boy upon Oblomov's death. Oblomov spends the rest of his life in a second Oblomovka, being taken care of by Agafia Pshenitsina like he used to be as a child. She can prepare many a succulent meal, and makes sure that Oblomov doesn't have a single worrisome thought. Sometime before his death he had been visited by Stoltz, who had promised to his wife a last attempt at bringing Oblomov back to the world, but without success. By then Oblomov had already accepted his fate, and during the conversation he mentions ""Oblomovitis"" as the real cause of his demise. Oblomov's end is quiet, much like the rest of his life.
","In this chapter, the narrator introduces Oblomonov, a thirty-year-old man living in a small apartment in the Russian city of Petrozavtsia. He looks worn and disheveled, his face discolored from lack of definite idea or reason. His eyes are closed but he does not seem to be troubled by any ill will; rather, he seems to be resigned to some kind of impending calamity. The narrator describes Oblgomov as ""a simpleton"" , meaning someone who has been forced to live off his back for three years without ever being able to exercise or eat properly. In other words, he's an invalid with a limp. When asked why he is lying there, Oblatov says that he sleeps because he wants to get up early so that he can prepare for the day's work. At about ten o'clock, Oblikov wakes up to find that another visitor has come to visit him. This new visitor is Mikhei Alexandru Tarkovsky, a former military officer who has just received a letter telling him to move out of Evremetyevo. Oblovomov invites him to join them on a trip to the Volgograd region where they plan to spend the next few months rebuilding their crumbling economy. After much coaxing and bickering, Obloomov agrees to go along. When Alexiev and Tarantiev leave the room to go back to their respective offices for the evening, they are surprised to find Oblomoov lying on his sofa. He begins to think about how he will improve his estate by improving it with modern conveniences such as architecture, gardens, and parks. When he falls asleep, he dreams of a future where everyone will live happily ever after. After tea, the household gathers for dinner and then goes for a stroll along the river. Soon afterward, they have another dream in which everything seems to be perfectly normal again. This time it is not just the house that is affected by the weirdness of the night before; it is also the village where Oblomoovka is located. The narrator notes that when the boy was very young, he used to dream about all sorts of strange places: Russia, China, France, Germany, England, etc. In other words, there are lots of weird things going on in this imaginary world. For example, an old Russian shepherd named Aleksey Mitrovsky lives with his wife and their two sons-in-law. He attends school at age 13 or 14. His teachers treat him as if he were a little boy who has been born into slavery. When he reaches adulthood, he will go back to school and become a full-blown orphan. After completing his education, he hopes to enter the civil service. Olgomov, meanwhile, spends the majority of his summer living in a villa owned by his aunt and uncle. During this time, he begins to notice signs of deterioration in his already worn-out state. For example, one winter morning, he runs into a group of boys who have stolen his socks. The boys are arrested and sentenced to be hanged for their crimes. He also receives a letter saying that he wants to move to Europe with her so that he can spend more time with her while she is there. After three days, he visits Olga at her aunt's house. She asks him to take her to an unoccupied villa where they can live together without having to worry about finding a job or paying rent. At first, he does not want to do anything, but then he decides to visit her anyway. One August day, he goes back to the villa only to discover that it has been rented out. There, he meets up with another friend, Tarkovsky, who invites him to dinner. They talk for a few minutes before he leaves. Soon, though, things seem to be going according to plan. Zakhar explains that Olga will be married shortly after Christmas, which means that the wedding must take place in a few months. In order to prevent this from happening, he arranges for his servants to secretly inform Olga and her aunt of the impending marriage. On Monday morning, when Oblatz arrives home, he finds Olga waiting for him outside with her maid. She tells him that she has been feeling ill and that she would like to know whether he is well enough to marry her. He refuses to answer her questions about his health or his financial situation. The following Monday, however, he receives a letter requesting him to visit Olga immediately. During their conversation, it becomes clear to both men that they are aware of one another's growing discontentment with life. They decide to meet again on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. . Oglomov has been suffering from depression and anxiety for a year now. He tells her that she is growing old, and asks her to stop worrying about him. She says that she does not want to become old; rather, she wants to live in peace and tranquility. They talk for a long time, and eventually he falls asleep on the cobbled path leading to his apartment. The next morning they meet Olga, who takes care of the household while Alexiev and Teta ulina are nursing their newborn baby. After Alexiev passes away, Olomonov regains consciousness but remains unconscious for five years. In those five years, nothing seems to have changed in the neighborhood. Only one person still lives in the area: Agafia Matvoyna, whose sister Irina serves as the housekeeper. Meanwhile, VOA reports that Oblomoov has had a stroke and lost most of his senses. His health declined rapidly during this time period. Finally, after several attempts at sedation, he finally recovers enough to return to work. advertisement",2.357327935005714,0.24179619546893139
Show Boat," The time is the late nineteenth century. Captain Andy Hawks is a former riverboat owner with a shrewish wife, Parthy Ann, and a ten-year-old daughter, Magnolia. He buys the new show boat Cotton Blossom. Among the actors are Julie Dozier and her husband Steve Baker, and Ellie Chipley and her husband, affectionately known as ""Schultzy"". Other members of the crew are Pete, the engineer of the towboat Mollie Able, which propels the show boat; Frank the utility man, and Windy McClain, the pilot. Steve and Julie are close, and Julie becomes Magnolia's best friend, showing motherly affection toward her. For a time, all is well, but soon Pete begins making unwanted advances toward Julie. He gets into a fist fight with Steve, is soundly beaten, and swears revenge. He implies knowing some dark secret concerning Julie. When the troupe arrives at Lemoyne, Mississippi, Pete steals Julie's picture from the box office and takes it to the local sheriff. Julie claims she does not feel well enough to perform, and Parthy observes that Julie fell sick the year before in the same town. When they hear what Pete has done, Steve takes out a pocket knife, makes a cut on Julie's hand, and sucks blood from it. The sheriff arrives and announces that there is a miscegenation case on board: since Julie is black and Steve is white, their marriage is illegal. Julie admits that she is half-black. Ellie, who has been very close to Julie, becomes upset at the revelation and hysterically denounces her friend. Steve says he has ""negro blood"" in him, and the rest of the company backs him up. The sheriff, not realizing that Steve's claim is based only on his having sucked some blood from Julie's hand (this refers to social conventions classifying as black anyone with known African ancestry), believes he cannot arrest the couple and leaves. He tells Steve and Julie to leave the boat, which they do, after Julie sorrowfully says goodbye to the girl Magnolia. Years later we return to the boat, where Magnolia is now eighteen and the newest leading lady. She has no leading man. After Gaylord Ravenal, a handsome riverboat gambler, is hired, he and Magnolia promptly fall in love and elope. Months later, Magnolia has had a baby daughter, whom she names Kim (because she was born at the moment when the Cotton Blossom was at the convergence on the Mississippi of the states of Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri). Shortly after, Captain Andy falls overboard during a storm and drowns. Rather than live with the stern Parthy, Magnolia and Ravenal leave for Chicago with Kim. In the big city, the couple is alternately rich and poor, depending on Ravenal's gambling winnings (he does not try to find regular work, and cheats on Magnolia with prostitutes). Finally, after about ten years, Parthy announces she is coming to visit; the destitute Ravenal, desperate for money, borrows some from Hetty Chilson, the local whorehouse madam. He returns to Magnolia at their boarding house but is drunk. As he sleeps off his stupor, she returns the money to Hetty, and discovers the madam's secretary is Julie Dozier. Julie is devastated that Magnolia has found her working in the whorehouse. (The fate of Steve goes unmentioned in the novel.) When Magnolia returns to the boarding house, she finds Ravenal gone, leaving nothing but a farewell note. She never sees him again. She goes out to get work and is hired at a local nightclub called Joppers. The story moves forward to 1926, when show boats are becoming scarce on the Mississippi River. Kim has married and become a successful actress on Broadway in New York City. Her father Ravenal has been dead for several years. One night, Magnolia receives a telegram announcing the death of her mother Parthy, from whom she has been long estranged. She returns to the show boat, which she decides to keep and manage, rather than to scrap. She gives all of her inheritance from Parthy, a fortune, to her daughter Kim. Joining Magnolia is Ellie, a widow since her husband Schultzy has died.
","The narrator notes that the novel is not history nor biographical but fiction, and does not intend to give away any of the facts or characters involved in the story. The narrator assumes that this is a factual account of events occurring in the United States during the early 1900s. However, he believes that there may be some truth in the statements made by statisticians regarding certain aspects of the historical record. For example, the narrator suggests that the book might contain references to real people who have lived their entire lives as well as fictionalized ones. In this case, however, we are referring to an unnamed woman whose name is Idylland Ravenal; her maiden name is pronounced ""Mississippi Ravenal""; her father is named Andy Hawks; her mother is Parthy Anne Hawks; and she is the wife of Major Andy Hawks. They sail for New Orleans from where they will spend one year before returning to their native St. Petersburg, Florida. On the way home, Grandfather John Hawks drives his boat full of passengers into the Mississippi river. He has been traveling all along with his wife since childhood. At the beginning of the novel, though, it seems like things are going according to plan. Magnolia adores her mother and Captain Andy on board the ship. She devotes most of her time to playing with them, even though she is not allowed to go anywhere by herself. Her mother also has a tendency to over-indulge Magnolia when she tries to sneak away from her mother in order to have sex with other women. The narrator tells us that this is where the tension between Mrs. Hawk and Major Poyser comes into play. In fact, it might be the beginning of an end to their relationship. After all, they are now engaged in business together. They work as pilots for a traveling showboat called the 'Cotton Blossoms'. Mr. Hawk takes charge of the entire operation during the course of the summer season. He spends his time supervising every aspect of the operation including cooking, cleaning, and running the shop. His attention is focused on making sure everything is set up correctly so that no one will suspect him of wrongdoing. One day, however, he sees a group of people sitting outside the shop window admiring a boat full of colorful fruits and vegetables. It turns out that these are members of the cast of the Broadway production of Annie Lennox's ""The Color Blossom,"" starring Amy Winehouse. A few moments later, there is a conversation between Pete Harker and Johnny Hawks about how much money each person should make if they want to live off the money they made at the showboat. Then there is another conversation about potluck food. This time it is Pet Shop Boys, which serves as a kind of entertainment for both children and adults alike. Magnolia Able Magnolia Able, the young girl in the cotton Blossom troupe, reunites with Captain Andy and her new husband, Captain Jim Hawks. They spend a number of months on the ship, rehearsing, and playing on it; they eat, sleep, and attend shows all over the country. The narrator notes that this is the first summer Magnolia has ever been apart from the rest of the family. She does not learn to read or write well, but she enjoys the sights and sounds of the big-budget Broadway show called The Cotton Blossom Flying Palace Theatre. During the spring and fall, the traveling band performs at various stages throughout the city. At one point, Major Parthy takes charge of the operation of the theater as well as serving as conductor for the entire cast. He also manages to keep everyone occupied during the day by supervising every aspect of the production. In addition, he keeps an eye out for any incidents that might occur while the group is performing. The narrator notes that in the past few years, Jim has been spending a lot of time with his playmate, Doc Soderbergh. He tells stories about pirates and how they used to rob and kill victims before they got their souls back. The narrator also notes that there are rumors that Pete would try to steal Julie from Steve by hooking her up with phony jewelry or giving her expensive gifts. In fact, one rumor has it that Pete tried to kidnap Julie as well. It is rumored that Pete attempted to steal both Julie and Juli during the springtime season. When this rumor is proven true, the narrator describes what happens to Juli when she returns home from the showboat. She becomes hysterical at the thought of being left alone with an old man who has ruined her life. Meanwhile, Captain Andy serves as the chief steward of the cotton blossoms aboard the boat called theotton Blossom. During the course of the summer, he takes care of all of the business for the company including advertising, ticket sales, and marketing. However, on October 15, Julie Dzier suffers a serious case of hypoglycemia. Surprised, she hurries off to get help. Captain Andy, along with the other members of the cast, berate Parthy for not taking care of the family well. He tells her that she is a mean woman and should be allowed to stay on board the Cotton Blossom as long as she pays attention to what's going on around her. Then he threatens to send them away if they do not show up by afternoon. The next morning, however, Captain Andy volunteers to take charge of the entire crew because there are some ""public spirited folks"" who want to see Magnolia get off the boat. Meanwhile, Amy has become an actress working in the traveling theater troupe called the cotton blossoms. At the end of the first season, Amy leaves a note saying that she will be returning to work at the theater after seven years. She also says that she wants to start acting again. In reality, Amy works as a seamstress for the traveling troupe until she gets tired of it and decides to go live in Louisiana instead. That night, Amy sees Magnolia aboard the ship bound for New Orleans; she recognizes her friend from afar but does not tell her about it until later. Raymond Ravenal is now the new addition to the traveling troupe of actors who used to work in the Louisiana stagecoach. Raymond, however, does not seem to be interested in anything but friendship and adoration. In fact, he has become so engrossed in his flirtatious behavior that Parthy begins to suspect him of having feelings for Magnolia after seeing her on the boat. The next day, Lancelot Ravenal goes ashore to speak with a young man named Frank. After talking for a while, they learn that Ravenal has been hired by Plumbridge as an assistant director. They decide to continue their relationship with Ravenal until Mattias return from Europe. Meanwhile, Major Ravenal spends time at the Box Office where he works as a pendantist. During this time, it becomes clear that MajorRavenal will no longer be allowed to visit Magnolia unless she agrees to accompany him to the theater afterward. The next morning, the Capers are late for breakfast. They have a little trouble convincing Magnolia that she should marry Robby Ravenal instead of her sweetheart, Captain Hawk. Then they run into Mis' Means, who tells them that their wedding is to take place the next day at 4:00AM. The Capers go off to buy some orange juice and gingerbread before heading on to meet up with their new bride-to-be. Once they get there, however, they find out that Matt has been shot in the arm. It turns out that he was trying to save money so he could help Magnolia when she needed it the most. In fact, this is where all the tension between Matt and his wife comes from. When Matt finally gets home, he tells his wife how devastated he is by the tragedy of losing his job as a professional gambler. He also tells her that he would like to see her again if she would just let him come back anytime soon. She agrees to go along with his plan. Magnolia, Kim, and her mother leave the cotton blossom business in Chicago for a new home in Maryland. They board a train headed for the Illinois rivers. The narrator notes that even though Magnolia does not like to be left behind, she still loves her daughter very much. She is also beginning to realize how little money her family actually has. For one thing, it seems as if they are spending all their money on expensive linens and fancy clothing instead of on real estate. For another thing, they have no friends. In fact, most of their money comes from gambling debts incurred during their lifetime in Chicago; however, when those debts are cleared, they spend it on luxuries such as hotels, restaurants, and theatres. These luxuries do not seem to be anywhere near what they once were. In this chapter, we delve deeper into the inner workings of a Chicago woman named Nola Ravenal who lives with her husband and their two young daughters, Kim and Blanche. She works as a traveling saleswoman for Magnolia's clothing company, Inc., but she is not paid to do so. In addition, she has become an escort for gamblers in order to avoid being labeled as a prostitute or a flight risk. As time passes, it becomes clear to us that these women are beginning to take on more responsibilities than they previously did. Magnolia thinks of Kim in the orphanage and wonders if she will ever be reunited with her father, who she calls a ""one-man"" man. The only thing separating them is their love for one another. In fact, they are so enamored of one another that they decide to visit each other at least once every two weeks. One week after this first visit, Parthenias Ann Hawks comes to Chicago as planned. She plans to spend Christmas with her mother and grandchild. However, she also plans to stay at Sherman House where she has been spending most of her time since childhood. At 9:00 p.m., Magnolia goes to wake up Kim from her nap. She realizes that it is nine oclock on December 30, and wakes up to find herself alone in a darkened room surrounded by boxes of furniture and empty tables. A black man named Ravenal approaches her and asks her name. He tells her that he is looking for someone to give her a thousand dollar check. She gives him the $1,000 instead. Afterward, she heads out to Jopper's Varieties , a neighborhood theater owned by wealthy New York real estate agent Kenneth Ravenal . When she gets there, she finds an old woman standing next to her whom she had befriended years before. They exchange pleasantries and then leave together. advertisement",1.5916482809765016,0.24910393815542267

","Chapter Eighteen and sixteen-year-old Frank and his younger sister, Kit, are preparing for their brother Francis' funeral dinner. They're excited about the upcoming arrival of Mr. Hamilton's ""artistic"" son, who will be joining the military soon. The narrator gives us a brief account of the history of this household: Before the Civil War, there were slaves who came to the South as indentured servants; during the Civil Rights Movement, they went from being childless to working men in order to make ends meet. By contrast, today, we're talking about rich, middle-class black men like Frank Hamilton, who has just graduated from college with a degree in Sociology. We also get a brief description of Frank's relationship with his older brother Francis, who is named after an English nobleman by the same name. It's not clear if Frank really wants to marry Fannie or not, but it certainly doesn't look good on him. He tells everyone that he saved all his money when he opened the safe at the pawnbroker's shop two days earlier. Oh yeah, and one last thing: Did you see how much money he put in the safe before he opened it? In other words, no amount of money could ever have gotten him into such trouble. And guess what? That money never made it out of here. Not even close. Berry is convicted and sentenced to ten years of hard labor. He faints on his way home after being woken up by Fannie's screams. Joe decides to go look for work in the hotel lobby, where he finds a job as a bellboy. The narrator gives us a brief account of Joe's experiences at the theater: ""There was a time when Joe was caught trying to hold back the laughter of the crowd"" . There are also hints that Joe might be interested in becoming a singer or actress. Joe goes out with some other young men who want to see New York City. They all agree to hang out one night at the Hamilton's , which means they have to leave their homes and move to somewhere else. It's a rough night, but Joe has a good time hanging out with these guys. Afterward, Joe asks Thomas if he can come over for dinner; Thomas says yes. Joe agrees to meet them later that night at a fancy restaurant called the 'Banner Club'. We're not going to spoil this story for you - we'll just skip ahead a little bit and let Joe tell you what happened. Joe goes to the theater with his friend Thomas, and they have a drink together. Joe tells Hattie that he is going to bring her over for supper. He says that he does not care what color she is; he just wants to be with her. When Hattie asks him who he is, he says that it is ""Mudy Brown"" from New York City. She has come to live in the country with Tom Soderball Jr., which makes her even more of a social outcast than before. The narrator gives us a brief history of Joe Hamilton's relationship with Hatties sister, Kitty Sterling. They had been best friends as young adults, but now they are bitter old enemies. In order to make up for all of their past bad behavior, Joe invites Hatties sisters-in-law, Mary, Fannie, and Harriet to dinner. Afterward, he takes off his clothes and goes to an opera house where he finds Hattie singing along with some clubmen. There, he sees Hattie sitting next to him waiting for him at the theater. This convinces Hattie so much that she agrees to try another song. A year later, Kitty Hamilton is engaged to be married. She has a son named Hattie who will not make it into the chorus until after her daughter's graduation in twenty-one years. A letter arrives from Paris that tells of Frank's successful sale of his art collection. It also says that he plans to give the money back to Claire when she marries him. This news troubles Frank greatly and makes him even more determined to elope with Claire. The next morning, Kitty returns home only to discover that Mr. Jarndyce has been arrested for robbing a bank. He informs her that Berry Hamilton was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Kitty then goes to visit her brother, whom she now calls ""Your Brother, Frank."" After Kitty leaves, Jerry Cruncher comes to pick up the letter and reads it aloud to himself. From this moment on, Kitty becomes very close to MauriceOakley. advertisement",3.882859519393907,0.26219511723397537

The Magic of Oz," At the top of Mount Munch, lives a group of people known as the Hyups. One of their numbers, a Munchkin named Bini Aru, discovered a method of transforming people and objects by merely saying the word ""Pyrzqxgl"". After Princess Ozma decreed that no one could practice magic in Oz except for Glinda the Good Witch and the Wizard of Oz, Bini wrote down the directions for pronouncing ""Pyrzqxgl"" and hid them in his magical laboratory. When Bini and his wife are at a fair one day, their son Kiki Aru, who thirsts for adventure, finds the directions and afterwards transforms himself into a hawk and visits various countries outside the land of Oz. When he alights in the land of Ev, Kiki Aru learns that he needs money to pay for a night's lodging (versus Oz, where money is not used at all) and changes himself into a magpie to steal a gold piece from an old man. A sparrow confronts the then-human Kiki Aru with knowledge of the theft, and Kiki says that he did not know what it was like to be wicked before, he is glad that he is now. This conversation is overheard by Ruggedo, the Nome who was exiled to the Earth's surface in Tik-Tok of Oz, and he sees through Kiki Aru's power a chance to get revenge on the people of Oz. Kiki changes himself and Ruggedo into birds and they fly over the Deadly Desert into the Land of Oz. They enter Oz as animals to escape detection by Glinda and to recruit an army of conquest from the country's wild animal population. When they first appear in the Forest of Gugu in the Gillikin Country, Kiki changes himself and Ruggedo into Li-Mon-Eags (fictional creatures with the heads of lions, the bodies of monkeys, and the wings of eagles as well as having the tails of donkeys) and lies that they've seen the people of the Emerald City plan to enslave the animal inhabitants of the Forest. Ruggedo claims that they the Li-Mon-Eags will transform the animals into humans and march on the Emerald City and transform its inhabitants into animals, driving them into the forest. Ruggedo proves their power (for Kiki's the only one who knows ""Pyrzqxgl"") by having Kiki transform one of the leopard king Gugu's advisors, Loo the unicorn, into a man and back again. Gugu offers to meet with the leaders of the other animal tribes to decide on this matter of invasion. Dorothy and the Wizard arrive with the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger in the Forest of Gugu during this council of war with a request for monkeys to train in time for Ozma's upcoming birthday party. Ruggedo recognizes his old enemies and inspires Kiki to begin transforming people and animals left and right &mdash; including Ruggedo, whom Kiki turns against by transforming him into a goose, a transformation that the Nomes most fears because as a goose he might lay an egg. The Wizard, whom Kiki transformed into a fox, follows the Li-Mon-Eag with his magic bag, the transformed Kiki, deep into the forest where he begins transforming monkeys into giant human soldiers. However, Kiki makes them so big that they cannot move through the trees. The Wizard, however, heard how to correctly pronounce ""Pyrzqxgl"" and first stops Kiki and Ruggedo by transforming them into a walnut and a hickory nut. Then the Wizard resumes his rightful form and changes Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, and Gugu back to their forms, and he agrees to change the soldiers back into monkeys. The Wizard recruits several of the grateful monkeys and shrinks them down to bring back to the Emerald City and train. On arriving there, Dorothy and the Wizard are dispatched to a magic island where Cap'n Bill and Trot went to get a magic flower for Ozma's birthday. However, the island itself causes anything living that touches it to take root there, and that is how the sailor and his friend are found when Dorothy and the Wizard arrive. The Wizard uses ""Pyrzqxgl"" to change Cap'n Bill and Trot into honeybees which narrowly avoid being eaten by the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger. When they are human again, Cap'n Bill retrieves the flower by strapping a wood plank onto his good leg, walks with that and his wooden leg onto the island, and retrieves the flower. Back at the Emerald City, Ozma and her friends celebrate her birthday (though without quite the pomp and fanfare from The Road to Oz) and then decide how to deal with the evil magicians transformed into nuts. The Wizard uses ""Pyrzqxgl"" to change them back to Kiki Aru and Ruggedo and make them thirsty enough to drink the Water of Oblivion, which will make them forget all that they have ever known. The now-blank slate Kiki Aru and Ruggedo will live in the Emerald City and learn to be good and kind.
","This is a short story and it does not directly address the actual plot of the novel. Instead, it focuses on two main characters in the book: Kiki , an orphaned man who has been exiled from Oz by Ozma; and his half-brother, Rounceo, who has transformed into a giant eagle. Both characters are very happy to be reunited with their old friends. Gugu the Lion explains that he has discovered a way of making emerald thread, using softening stones, into long strands. The Emerald City will have a feast on Ozmas birthday and all its friends will gather there to celebrate. He suggests that they make a big cake with lots of frosting , then train the animals in how to do their tasks. They also plan to have a party at the royal palace where everyone will be invited. Then they go to the wizard-or-the-wizard, who is studying magic so that he can perform his wizardry for her. There, they meet two loon-beas, the Monkey King, Rangoon the Lion, Bru the Bears, LOO the Unicorn; Kiki from the Green Ape; and Gorilla from the White Ape . Gugu tells them what they need to know before they set off: whether or not they should join forces against the evil kalidahs whom they believe to be descended from God. When they finally arrive at the magical island, they are surprised to see that the island is actually made up entirely of trees rather than of wood. But once they get there, they find out that it really is just a small island full of trees surrounded by forest. It turns out that this island is home to some sort of Magic Flower--a kind of edible plant that people use to decorate their houses. Once inside, they learn more about the land and its inhabitants. In order to help them escape, they convince the monkey king to allow them to take possession of the whole island. The Lion and the Pomfret are surprised to see these new arrivals, who they think are their enemies. They also realize that they cannot really know he is the former king of the nomes because of his beast-like form. The Lion explains that he has been transformed from a lion to a goose. Then there are some more transformations on the animals as well. Finally it is time for the travelers to head back to Ozma's palace in order to help him break out of his enchantment. But before they can do so, one of the travelers runs into the Wizard's black bag with all his magic tools. He uses this bag to transform himself into a fox. And then he does what any good magician would do: he changes the color of the monkeys into plums. Oh, yeah, and finally he gives up his bag of magic tools and lets the monkeys go free. Yay! The Wizard explains that he will not allow the travelers to see their friends until after Ozma has had her birthday. The travelers leave Gugu and head into the forest with the monkey population, hoping to catch a glimpse of Magic Isle before it is too late. Unfortunately, they come upon a group of giant soldiers who have been waiting for them all along the Magic Island. Luckily, the travelers are able to save the soldiers by using a dish made from silver-on-the-outside and gold inside. They also find a magical island called the Magic City, which serves as a sort of miniaturized version of the magic island. It also serves as an escape route for the travelers once they get there. Meanwhile, in the countryside, everyone celebrates Dorothy's birthday: the Hippolyte, the Monkey, the Lion , the Tullow Dog, the Pig, and several other animals. advertisement",2.111820040045051,0.2964028727338751
The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle," A little girl named Lucie lives on a farm called Little-town. She is a good little girl, but has lost three pocket handkerchiefs and a pinafore. She questions Tabby Kitten and Sally Henny-penny about them, but they know nothing. Lucie mounts a stile and spies some white cloths lying in the grass high on a hill behind the farm. She scrambles up the hill along a steep path-way which ends under a big rock. She finds a little door in the hillside, and hears someone singing behind it: :Lily-white and clean, oh! :With little frills between, oh! :Smooth and hot – red rusty spot :Never here be seen, oh! She knocks. A frightened voice cries out, ""Who's that?"" Lucie opens the door, and discovers a low-ceilinged kitchen. Everything is tiny, even the pots and pans. At the table stands a short, stout person wearing a tucked-up print gown, an apron, and a striped petticoat. She is ironing. Her little black nose goes sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes go twinkle, twinkle, and beneath her little white cap are prickles! She is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, the animals' laundress and ""an excellent clear-starcher"". She keeps busy with her work. She has found Lucy's lost things, and launders them for her. She also shows Lucie items belonging to Mrs. Tiggywinkle's animal customers. The laundered clothing is tied up in bundles and Lucie's handkerchiefs are neatly folded into her clean pinafore. They set off together down the path to return the fresh laundry to the little animals and birds in the neighbourhood. At the bottom of the hill, Lucie mounts the stile and turns to thank Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. ""But what a very odd thing!"" Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is ""running running running up the hill"". Her cap, shawl, and print gown are nowhere to be seen. How small and brown she has grown – and covered with prickles! ""Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle [is] nothing but a HEDGEHOG!"" The narrator tells the reader that some thought Lucie had fallen asleep on the stile and dreamed the encounter, but if so, then how could she have three clean handkerchiefs and a laundered pinafore? ""Besides,"" the narrator assures the reader, ""I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Catbells – and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!""

The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel," The story starts in Paris in April 1794, year II of the French Revolution. Theresia Cabarrus is a beautiful but shallow Spaniard who is betrothed to Citizen Tallien the popular Representative in the Convention and one of Robespierre's inner circle. She is credited with exercising a mellowing influence over Tallien, whom she met in Bordeaux but although she is engaged to be married to him, what little love she has appears to be lavished on another. Bertrand Moncrif is a good-looking but impulsive young man who appears determined to martyr himself in opposition to the revolutionary government. To this end, he has gathered the siblings of his long-term sweetheart, Régine de Serval, into his plan to denounce Robespierre at one of the Fraternal suppers. Despite warnings from Régine he insists on carrying through his plans which inevitably go awry and the wrath of the mob is soon turned towards the small group. After a timely intervention on the part of the Scarlet Pimpernel, using the guise of the coal heaver Rateau (who also appears in several short stories in The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel - The Cabaret de la Liberté, Needs Must and A Battle of Wits), the de Servals are saved from a lynching while Moncrif lies unconscious and unseen under a table. When he eventually awakens, Bertrand heads straight for Theresia's house (whom he worships) and all thoughts of his old love Régine disappear in her wake. Theresia is horrified to find him at her house as Tallien, Robespierre and several other high-ranking political figures are due at her apartment for a meeting. Realising that he is putting her at risk, Bertrand hides in the kitchen while the men meet. Also present is Citizen Chauvelin, who plans to use Theresia to entrap his old enemy the Scarlet Pimpernel and has been planting ideas to the effect in Robespierre's mind. Robespierre makes it clear that he knows Bertrand was behind the fracas at the supper and implies that Theresia and Bertrand are involved. Despite the implied threat, she refuses to help trap the Pimpernel, but after the party has left she discovers that Bertrand has been taken by the daring Englishman from her kitchen. Chauvelin returns brandishing a note left by the Pimpernel, to persuade her to take part in his plan once more. Peeved at the Pimpernel removing her plaything, she eventually agrees. In England, Moncrif and the de Servals are finally free to resume an almost normal life. Theresia arrives at Dover dressed in men's clothes and claiming she has been driven out of France by her association with Bertrand, in fear of her life. An obviously staged row between the Spaniard and Chauvelin outside Sir Percy's cottage fails to persuade our hero that she is up to anything but mischief, but he seems to relish the prospect of such an intelligent and wily adversary and promises not to reveal her true identity to anyone for he ""is a lover of sport."" With her plans to seduce Percy scuppered, Theresia turns her attention to Sir Percy's wife Marguerite and uses an all too willing Bertrand to set the trap. Lady Blakeney is kidnapped yet again and taken to France and imprisoned as bait for Sir Percy. Can our dashing hero evade capture and live to enjoy a day ""when tyranny was crushed and men dared to be men again""? de:The Scarlet Pimpernel fr:Le Mouron rouge
","In this chapter, the narrator focuses on a conversation between Madame Ragueneau and Roxane Cunegonde. They are conversing about the events of the year 1794 in which they have taken place: the siege of Paris, the burning of the citadel, the destruction of the aristocracy, the torture of convicts, the murder of revolutionaries, the hanging of Monsieur de Bourgogne-Guilbert, and so on. The narrator notes that these events take place almost five years after the death of the famous revolutionary leader, who was executed for his role in the conspiracy against Danton. In those five years, the revolutionaries have seen little or no change in their fortunes. Their hopes seem to have dimmed as time passes. A young black man is brought into the house by Madame Ranguegonde; it is rumored that he has been living there for more than half an hour. He asks if anyone can help him. No one will listen except Cyrano, whom he professes to love very much. After some coaxing from Cyrano , the old gypsy woman takes charge of the situation. She then instructs the boy to go with her to the church where she lives. When he returns, she tells him that all three of them must leave immediately. As soon as he leaves, Cyrano falls asleep. Rappeine tells Bertrand about her meeting with the mysterious woman. She says that she fears for everyone involved in the revolution, but Bertrand points out that it is only a small minority of people who are affected by the revolutionary movement. He asks her to help stop the revolutionaries from destroying the Republic. She responds that she has no influence over the revolutionaries and will never be able to prevent them from starting their own rebellion. In an attempt to pacify her, however, she accuses Bertrand of using her as a weapon against the revolutionaries. When Bertrand finally agrees to Rappeau's plan, he throws two bodies into the flames of a nearby fire-crest. The crowd screams ""RESPECT! RESPECT!"" As the mob begins to disperse, they drag Rateau offstage. At last, he emerges from his hiding place behind a large oak tree. His face is contorted with grotesque eyes and mouth full of toothless teeth. It seems as if someone has placed a curse on him. After some time, he regains consciousness. A mysterious form emerges from under a table near the house of Robebierre. It's Bertrand , who has just been knocked senseless by his giant fist. He runs away, but when he comes back, he sees that someone else has also been in the room with him. This person is named Citizen Tullien and it turns out to be Monsieur de la Roche-Saint-Justeau, an aristocrat friend of Lucie's. These two people are supposed to have helped robespierre escape punishment for his treachery. They're both sentenced to guillotines at the age of twenty-four. In 1794 France, we find ourselves in the home of Madame Ragueneau, the most powerful woman in the Republic. We also learn that she lives in the apartment of her wealthy lover, Count Alexandre de Guiche. She works as a governess on Rue Saint Honoré, which means that she can't really do anything but sit around and think about what's going on behind her closed door. As soon as this happens, however, things seem to get even more heated between them. A certain young man named Tallien arrives--he's gorgeous, well-dressed, and beautiful. He asks to see some of the revolutionaries before they go to their trial. The narrator tells us that these are the revolutionaries' last hurries. In this chapter, the revolutionaries and their supporters gather in a small room at the Hotel Saint Honoré in Paris. They discuss the robbery of the Capuchin friar Bertrand; they also discuss the mysterious Scarlet Pimppernel , an English spy who has been spying on them for several years. When asked by Theresias question about it, she says that she does not recognize any of those traitors. She then asks if Tallien can help her find out more about the identity of the traitor. This leads to a heated discussion among the revolutionaries over whether or not Moncriff should be allowed to stay in Paris with his mistress. At this point, Lord Hastings steps forward and interrupts the conversation. He informs Theresios that he has found a note addressed to her asking her to help retrieve Bertrand from France. In response, she tells him that she will take him to England as soon as possible. Afterward, she goes to sleep. Chapter XIII The Scarlet's Rest A few years later, Frenchmen arrive at the inn where Captain Jacques Blakeney is being taken prisoner. The narrator tells us that no one in the neighborhood of the Blakenseys really knows about their little nest, which sits on a small hill outside Dover. But Sir Percy says he'll tell them later. They sit and talk for a while, enjoying each other's company. The narrator notes that people tend to keep secrets from their loved ones because they don't want to be caught or revealed. For instance, when Robespriters old friend Lucie sent him a message saying she'd be coming back soon, he didn't know what to do. Then there's this strange woman who shows up unexpectedly at the window. She's named Theresias cabarrus , her brother's fiancee; her sister-in-law is also an English noblewoman; her husband has fled to England as a fugitive spy. It seems like a long time ago that these two women were romantically linked, but now they seem to have fallen in love with each other. This makes Sir Percy even more determined to help her. That night, theresia wakes up to find Bertrand in bed with a paper on his lap. She tells him that she is safe in England through the services of the "" Scarlet Pimppernel,"" her former aide-in-waiting. When he asks what happened, she explains that she was rescued from Robesprey's apartment by the same man who had tried to assassinate Madame de Villers-Guilbert. Afterward, she writes a letter to Rosalind asking her to come to England with them. The following day, they board a coach bound for Dover. They arrive at Richmond Park just before dawn. There are five people waiting to help them get there safely. Theresia is taken to a small apartment in an impoverished part of Paris, where she finds comfort in food and fresh clothes. She wonders why the French authorities treat her so poorly when she has no means of escape. She also realizes that she now stands as a prisoner--a victim of ""the fiends"" who want to use her as leverage for their own ends. At this point, Chambertins voice comes from somewhere deep within the French psyche telling her that she should be careful not to fall prey to these fiends' schemes. He tells her that if she does not comply with his orders, then he will kill her. In other words, it's time to get out of France. Chauvelin explains to Sir Percy that the guards are watching him closely and will shoot him if he does not show up at the appointed hour. He also tells Sir Percy about the plan to capture Theresias lover in four days' time. When Sir Percy refuses to allow him to leave, Blakene-Cabarrus-Jacques-Guilbert-Garcia-Couvelin-has-him-by-the-bootlegger-straightened-out-his-cravat scheme. In other words, they're going to jail her for running away with a traitorous letter from Madame de Villeneuve. At this point, it becomes clear to everyone involved that there's no hope of escape. Everyone except Forresia is locked up in a storage room where she can't get out any time soon. Meanwhile, Cyrano-Manette has been secretly eavesdropping on La Rochefouche--he knows all about everything but wants to make sure that his daughter gets what she wants. Chauvelin tells Rateau that he saw him with the Evremond at the siege of Paris two days earlier. He also says that if Tallien does not tell the truth about what happened to him, then the state will pay him. When the storm breaks, everyone is inside the theater except Forresia who sits in a box near her apartment. She has been sitting there since the storm began and now she is surrounded by crowds of people waiting to see what happens to her. At 7:00AM on July 9th, the revolutionaries have arrested Theresias cabarrus for plotting with the French government. A group of soldiers searches her apartment but find nothing incriminating. Then they drag her body into the room where she was sleeping. They use a knife to slit her throat and stuff her mouth with the letter ""R"" , which means ""redeemer."" It turns out that the revolutionaries are planning to put her on trial the following day for seducing a Capuchin monk named Rateau . In the meantime, some Englishmen sneak up behind her and kill her. No one can figure out how they did it--it's all a trick of the dark web. advertisement",1.057108033023803,0.23045267052337895
The Cricket on the Hearth," John Peerybingle, a carrier, lives with his young wife Dot, their baby boy and their nanny Tilly Slowboy. A cricket constantly chirps on the hearth and acts as a guardian angel to the family. One day a mysterious elderly stranger comes to visit and takes up lodging at Peerybingle's house for a few days. The life of the Peerybingles intersects with that of Caleb Plummer, a poor toymaker employed by the miser Mr. Tackleton. Caleb has a blind daughter Bertha, and a son Edward, who traveled to South America and was thought dead. The miser Tackleton is now on the eve of marrying Edward's sweetheart, May, but she does not love Tackleton. Tackleton reveals to John Peerybingle that his wife Dot has allegedly cheated on him and shows him a clandestine scene where Dot embraces the mysterious lodger who is in disguise, a man much younger than he actually seems. John is cut to the heart over this as he loves his wife dearly, but decides after some deliberations to relieve his wife of their marriage contract. In the end, the mysterious lodger is revealed to be none other than Edward who has returned home in disguise. Dot shows that she indeed has been faithful to John. Edward marries May hours before she is scheduled to marry Tackleton. However Tackleton's heart is melted by the Christmas season, like Ebenezer Scrooge, and he surrenders May to her true love.
","Charles Dickens' Christmas books are described in great detail. The first book, ""The Christmas Carol,"" is the most successful and best-known of the series. It features four small books: The Chimes, Cricket On the Hearth, The Haunted Man, and The Croquet on thehearth. The second book includes a short story about a boy named Haymaker who tries to learn how to play the game of cricket by singing along with his fellow choruses. The third book introduces Mr. Tot, an orphaned canary whose mother has become hysterical at the thought that her son might be dead. The final volume focuses on John Peeringle, the tinkerer from New York. He lives next door to the Peerybbingles, whom he affectionately refers to as ""the Boxer"" or simply as ""Tilly"". After dinner, John brings home a box containing a wedding cake. When Dot asks him where it is, John tells her that they will meet again next Thursday for dinner. The Blind Girl arranges for a chair in Caleb's chimney to be placed beside him so that he can sit on it while May plays with the baby. The house is finished and ready for the delivery of the new baby, which will take place on January 21st. In addition to the doll's room, there are tenement apartments for low-income Dolls as well as large estates for higher-class Dolls. May asks Caleb if he has news for her father. Caleb replies that he does not yet know what day it is, but predicts that it will be the day that he marries May. He also tells his daughter that she cannot go to Bedminster unless she gives up her position as the blind girl's governess. After Caleb departs, May says goodbye to Caleb and then leaves the house. On the way home, they run into an old man whom they call ""Old John"" who tries to get them to tell him about their upcoming marriage. The Carrier sits down to have tea with his wife. He tells her that he is sorry for what he has done to her and asks her to talk to him about her health. She agrees, and they begin playing cribbage together. After a while, however, she gets tired of the game and goes back to her room. Caleb comes in and says that it is time for bed. They go over to the stable where Micah and Little Red Riding Hood are sleeping. Micah falls asleep on the seat next to Tuckett's body. Asleep at the wheel, Micah cries out ""Mother! Mother! Mother!"" . The Carrier then takes Micah into his arms and kisses her forehead. This makes Micah cry even more. It does not take long for this scene to develop. advertisement",1.241752450875351,0.24882628650344954
The Tower of London," The plot begins with Lady Jane Grey, wife of Guilford Dudley and daughter-in-law to the Duke of Northumberland, as she enters the Tower of London on 10&nbsp;July 1553. Prior to her entrance into the Tower, she ruled as Queen of England for nine days after she and her husband were put on the throne by the Duke of Northumberland. Soon after, Mary I was able to take control of England and sent the Duke to be executed. Dudley, in order to gain back the kingdom, formed a rebellion, which results in failure and the imprisonment of both himself and his wife. After the imprisonment, Simon Renard, the Spanish Ambassador to England, arranges a marriage between Mary and Philip of Spain in order to bring a Catholic take over of England. The events of the book alternate between historical background and the plot of Lady Jane. In Book II, incidents throughout the history of England from William the Conqueror to the 1820 Cato Street conspiracy are mentioned. The novel returns to Lady Jane busying herself with prayer as she awaits her execution with her only hope for freedom is to become a Catholic. * Lady Jane Grey * Guilford Dudley * John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland * Mary I * Philip of Spain * Xit (Sir Narcissus Le Grand) * Og, Gog and Magog * Winwike * Cuthbert Cholmondeley * Mistress Cicely * Nightgall * Elizabeth The novel is illustrated with 40 engravings and 58 woodcuts by Cruikshank. The illustrations depict moments from the story while the woodcuts show off architectural features related to the Tower. Ainsworth was grateful for the illustrations to the novel, and he wrote in the preface that ""it was no slight satisfaction to him, that circumstances at length enabled him to carry into effect his favourite project, in conjunction with the inimitable artist whose designs accompany the work.""
","This chapter introduces the plot of Sir Walter Scott's e-book, which takes place in London Tower during King Henry V's reign and peaks at the height of English literature in the early 1300s. It also introduces a number of other important events that take place outside the Tower during this time period. For example, there are scenes involving knights being hanged for their loyalty to the king. There are also references to the infamous White Tower , which was occupied by King John from 1413 until his death in 1216. Finally, there were references to Buckingham Palace . The narrator notes that these are all very significant events in the history book. This chapter introduces the events of King Henry V, Part I and Act iv. The reign of Henry IV is described with realism as follows: England was prospering under Yorkists rule, but there were still pockets of rebellion in England that did not favor the interests of the English monarchy. King Henry VI used Tower Hill as a hideout for his evil plots. His eldest son Clarence mysteriously disappears; his brother Clarence has been captured by Richard III. In 1487, Prince Edward IV pardons Lancelot de Bois-Guilbert, who tried to escape from the tower on charges of treason. Buckingham's last words are that he dies a true lord to the king. This chapter also focuses on the trials and tribulations of Lady Jane Gray, the queen's companion during her lifetime. Both she and William Howard die young. Elizabeth is executed on April 12, 1555. Sir Thomas Fitzgibbon is hanged on June 16, 1655. Anne serves as Queen Elizabeth's nursemaid throughout her reign. The Tower is described in great detail, with details such as the time period from 1680 to 1885 and the date of its construction in 1694. The White Tower was originally a prison for political prisoners but has since been converted into a brothels. In addition, there are many other notable figures who have escaped from the tower including Sir Robert Walton, Thomas More, Lord Palmerston, John Dryden, Henry V, James Fitz-Guilbert, Prince Charles, Lady Hawke, and several others. Finally, we move to the infamous ""Bathroom"" , where King George IV had ordered his execution. This chapter also focuses on the aftermath of Richard III's execution. He dies surrounded by his family at Windsor Castle. This chapter is set at the height of the summer heat in 1688. The narrator tells us that King Charles II and his entourage visited the Tower on their way to visit Queen Elizabeth, who was pregnant with her first child when it was discovered that she might have been pregnant. They also went to see a private chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Then they walked around Tower Hill for a while until they came upon a group of Roman Catholic prisoners whom they had tried to capture but were found not guilty. In Chapter IV, the narrator describes two memorable incidents in the life of the imprisoned Roman Catholic clergyman John Archer. First, he describes the execution of William Penn by Sir William Laird, then Lord Chief Minister of England. Second, there is the trial of John Ashby by Robert Barking as an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession of the crown jewels belonging to the English royal family. Both men are hanged. The church has a history of its own. In 1487, an earthquake destroyed the tower and killed many people in the area. It also had a chapel dedicated to the Virgin that is now occupied by the Abbey of Burdensheath. The townspeople who live near the church call themselves Barking but do not use the old name. They are often referred to as allhallows because they are so close to the medieval Tower. There used to be a Franciscan friar there, but this friar was banished from England for refusing to attend religious services. A year later, Richard III took over the presidency of King Edward IV with the help of his brother, Henry IV. He then went on to rule England for forty years until he died at the age of eighty-five. All Hallows has three chapels: the first , the second , and the third , which were built between 1666 and 1680. Both chapels serve as places of worship for both the clergy and the general public. As we move closer to the cathedral, we notice more details about the building than we have before. advertisement",1.2391381773332242,0.17406749119680484
Far from the Madding Crowd," Gabriel Oak is a young shepherd. With the savings of a frugal life, and a loan, he has leased and stocked a sheep-farm. He falls in love with a newcomer eight years his junior, Bathsheba Everdene, a proud beauty who arrives to live with her aunt, Mrs. Hurst. She comes to like him well enough, and even saves his life once, but when he makes her an unadorned offer of marriage, she refuses; she values her independence too much and him too little. Gabriel's blunt protestations only serve to drive her to haughtiness. After a few months, she moves to Weatherbury, a village some miles off. When next they meet, their circumstances have changed drastically. An inexperienced new sheep dog drives Gabriel's flock over a cliff, ruining him. After selling off everything of value, he manages to settle all his debts, but emerges penniless. He seeks employment at a work fair in the town of Casterbridge (a fictionalised version of Dorchester). When he finds none, he heads to another fair in Shottsford, a town about ten miles from Weatherbury. On the way, he happens upon a dangerous fire on a farm and leads the bystanders in putting it out. When the veiled owner comes to thank him, he asks if she needs a shepherd. She uncovers her face and reveals herself to be none other than Bathsheba. She has recently inherited the estate of her uncle and is now a wealthy woman. Though somewhat uncomfortable, she hires him. Meanwhile, Bathsheba has a new admirer: the lonely and repressed William Boldwood. Boldwood is a prosperous farmer of about forty whose ardour Bathsheba unwittingly awakens when – her curiosity piqued because he has never bestowed on her the customary admiring glance – she playfully sends him a valentine sealed with red wax on which she has embossed the words ""Marry me"". Boldwood, not realising the valentine was a jest, becomes obsessed with Bathsheba, and soon proposes marriage. Although she does not love him, she toys with the idea of accepting his offer; he is, after all, the most eligible bachelor in the district. However, she postpones giving him a definite answer. When Gabriel rebukes her for her thoughtlessness, she fires him. When her sheep begin dying from bloat, she discovers to her chagrin that Gabriel is the only man who knows how to cure them. Her pride delays the inevitable, but finally she is forced to beg him for help. Afterwards, she offers him back his job and their friendship is restored. At this point, the dashing Sergeant Francis ""Frank"" Troy returns to his native Weatherbury and by chance encounters Bathsheba one night. Her initial dislike turns to infatuation after he excites her with a private display of swordsmanship. Gabriel observes Bathsheba's interest in the young soldier and tries to discourage it, telling her she would be better off marrying Boldwood. Boldwood becomes aggressive towards Troy and she goes to Bath to prevent Troy returning to Weatherbury, as she fears Troy may be harmed on meeting Boldwood. On their return, Boldwood offers his rival a large bribe to give up Bathsheba. Troy pretends to consider the offer, then scornfully announces they are already married. Boldwood withdraws humiliated and vows revenge. Bathsheba soon discovers that her new husband is an improvident gambler with little interest in farming. Worse, she begins to suspect that he does not love her. In fact, Troy's heart belongs to her former servant, Fanny Robin. Before meeting Bathsheba, Troy had promised to marry Fanny; on the wedding day, however, the luckless girl goes to the wrong church. She explains her mistake, but Troy, humiliated at being left waiting at the altar, angrily calls off the wedding. When they part, unbeknownst to Troy, Fanny is pregnant with his child. Some months afterward, Troy and Bathsheba encounter Fanny on the road, destitute, as she painfully makes her way toward the Casterbridge workhouse. Troy sends his wife onward with the horse and gig before she can recognise the girl, then gives her all the money in his pocket, telling her he will give her more in a few days. Fanny uses up the last of her strength to reach her destination. A few hours later, she dies in childbirth, along with the baby. Mother and child are then placed in a coffin and sent home to Weatherbury for interment. Gabriel, who has long known of Troy's relationship with Fanny, tries to conceal the child's existence – but Bathsheba, suspecting the truth and wild with jealousy, arranges for the coffin to be left in her house overnight. When all the servants are in bed, she unscrews the lid and sees the two bodies inside – her husband's former lover and their child. Troy then comes home from Casterbridge, where he had gone to keep his appointment with Fanny. Seeing the reason for her failure to meet him, he gently kisses the corpse and tells the anguished Bathsheba, ""This woman is more to me, dead as she is, than ever you were, or are, or can be."" The next day he spends all his money on a marble tombstone with the inscription ""Erected by Francis Troy in beloved memory of Fanny Robin..."". Then, loathing himself and unable to bear Bathsheba's company, he leaves. After a long walk he bathes in the sea, leaving his clothes on the beach. A strong current carries him away, though he is rescued by a rowing boat. A year later, with Troy presumed drowned, Boldwood renews his suit. Burdened with guilt over the pain she has caused him, Bathsheba reluctantly consents to marry him in six years, long enough to have Troy declared dead. Troy, however, is not dead. When he learns that Boldwood is again courting Bathsheba, he returns to Weatherbury on Christmas Eve to claim his wife. He goes to Boldwood's house, where a party is underway, and orders Bathsheba to come with him; when she shrinks back in surprise, he seizes her arm, and she screams. At this, Boldwood shoots Troy dead and tries unsuccessfully to turn the gun on himself. Although he is condemned to hang for murder, his friends petition the Home Secretary for mercy, citing insanity. This is granted and Boldwood's sentence is changed to ""confinement during Her Majesty's pleasure"". Bathsheba, profoundly chastened by guilt and grief, buries her husband in the same grave as Fanny and their child, and adds a suitable inscription. Throughout her tribulations, she comes to rely more and more on her oldest and (as she admits to herself) only real friend, Gabriel. When he gives notice that he is leaving her employ for California, she finally realises how important he has become to her well-being. That night, she goes alone to visit him in his cottage, to find out why he is (in her eyes) deserting her. Pressed, he reluctantly reveals that it is because people have been injuring her good name by gossiping that he wants to marry her. She exclaims that it is ""...too absurd – too soon – to think of, by far!"" He bitterly agrees that it is absurd, but when she corrects him, saying that it is only ""too soon"", he is emboldened to ask once again for her hand in marriage. She accepts, and the two are quietly wed.
","Farmer Oak, a young farmer and friend of Gabriel Oak's, is approached by a woman who asks him to let her into his house. He does not want the woman to pass because she is too late for the cow that he has been milking. The woman tells him that she will be returning home after seven days if he will let her in. She also says that she wants to know his name so that she can inquire about his family before she goes on with her visit. When they arrive at their house, they find a young woman with a child on her back. She introduces herself as Gabriel Oak and explains that she lives near the Hurst plantation. They place the child next to its mother and then go inside. As they are leaving the house, an old man named Gabriel Oak sees a young girl riding down a hillside. It turns out that this is the same young woman whom he had met the day before. She is described as beautiful, well-dressed, and well-to-do. She takes off her cloak and puts on a bright red jacket; when she returns home, she looks quite handsome. The narrator notes that the Hurst household is divided into two parts. One part is devoted to Gabriel and the other to a single woman, who has been living in the Norcombe area for twenty-five years. The narrator also notes that there are no regular ways to get from love to marriage. In this chapter, the narrator focuses on one such avenue: the road leading to Wuthering Heights. This avenue leads to Woodstock Grange, home of the Shrewsbury Witches. On this particular day, Gabriel passes by a dilapidated house owned by his wealthy landowner, George Oak. He stops at a roadside inn where he finds a hired sheepherder waiting for him outside the village gate. There, he meets Oak, an athletic shepherd with a sharp tongue. Oak tells him that he must find a job as a bailiff or something else. After Oak departs, Gabriel returns to the cottage, only to discover that he has fallen asleep beneath a pile of straw near a bonfire. When he wakes up, he realizes that it is now night, and plans to go to the nearby fairgrounds instead. The chapter opens with a discussion of the fortunes of Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow, who is now deceased but still very much alive. They are discussing Fanny Rouncewell, whom they all recognize as the daughter of the local farmer, Joseph Littlebury. The narrator tells us that Liddy has been living at the Lowes for the last twelve months because her uncle died while he was away on a trip to England. In Chapter Eight, the conversation turns to the welfare of women and their families. Many of the men in the community relate stories of how they have been affected by the loss of their loved ones. For example, one woman says that she hears footsteps approaching the house; another asks if anyone knows where Fanny is. No one answers except Henery Frizell, who wants to know what is going on. A voice announces that someone has come into the house saying that Fanny has run away from the soldiers. Everyone immediately assumes that it is Maryann Quickgrass, the vicar's granddaughter. The next morning, on a snowy night in mid-January, at Wuthering Heights, the townspeople of Weatherbury are gathered for a meeting. The weather is described in vivid detail by Liddy as flatness and darkness with no distinguishing features. A voice announces that it is Sergeant Troy, who has just arrived from France. When Liddy asks where he is going to find his wife, she tells him that she will take care of her. Later that same day, when Liddy goes to fetch Gabriel, they run into each other again. This time, though, there is only one person present: farmer Bede. Bede introduces himself as Lieutenant Colonel Tulliver Oak, then explains that he is now married to Monsieur Barlow, formerly Head Constable of the Yeomanry Guards. He also reveals that he has received a letter from Fanny asking him to marry her. After much debate, Bede finally agrees to go along with the plan. On Valentine's Day, Blytheba gives birth to a litter of baby lambs. Boldwood is sitting in his stall at the All Saints' and All Souls church one day when he hears a strange sound. He goes up to see it, but instead of seeing what she is doing, he sees her shadowed by an old man who looks as if he has just thrown a pebble into the water. The old man tells him that they are going to have a wedding next week. As soon as this happens, Boldwood realizes that he will not be able to attend the wedding because he is too busy with his dreams. In other words, he won't be attending the wedding either. Then again, why would he want to? Because he doesn't want to go through with the whole wedding thing now? But he also wants to make sure that Bathheba does not get upset by his presence on the farm. Finally, though, he agrees to marry her. The shearing takes place in a large barn, with the exception of one incident in which an injured ewe is successfully sheared. In that case, four die and three recover without operation. On top of that, there are forty-nine successful operations being performed on the sheep. During this time period, all the members of Weatherbury society seem to be doing their best to remain healthy and active. The narrator notes that men tend to lose their minds when they get too old or senile; however, women tend to keep their minds off important matters. One such day, while working at the dairy, young Barry Boldwood comes into the barn and tries to unfastle Bathheba. He apologizes profusely for what he has done, then goes inside to kiss her goodnight. She accepts his apology gratefully. A few weeks later, as dawn breaks, Bethanyba approaches her haymakers looking for someone to untie her skirt. It turns out it is none other than Sergeant Troy , who had attended college but was sent back to military service. The sergeant apologizes for his rudeness and tells her that he does not derive pleasure from her beauty. He also reminds her of the fact that she has been taught to conceal her mind, which leads him to believe that she is a very beautiful woman. The two engage in a long conversation about love and then go their separate ways. One evening while they are out, Bathheba asks Gabriel to take her on a walk with her. She says that she wants to see a swordfight but cannot stand it because it involves too much bloodshed. When she gets there, she sees Troy standing near her. He takes off his hat and ties it around his neck so that he can't see her face. Then he kisses her. Lydia Smallbury is on a honeymoon when she runs into Mr. Burdock, who has just returned from his military duty in Bath. He tells her that he will marry her if she will let him. Lydias reaction to this news is shockingly similar to the one she had expressed earlier about wanting to elope with someone else. She responds by saying that she does not want to be associated with such a person as herself. In the meantime, Beth finds out that Maryann is also on her honeymoon and plans to visit Liddy instead of going to Bath for the evening. The next day, they go looking for their missing lover. They finally find him but can't find him because there is no way to track him down without damaging his reputation. So they decide to head back home. Boldwood returns to the carrier's house, where he meets Troy. He apologizes profusely for his violence against Liddy and tells Boldwood that he cannot marry Bathshebene because she is only a lowly servant. Troy explains that he will pay him fifty pounds if he marries her. After Troy leaves, they both sit down on the grass by the side of the stable. They are interrupted by a loud thunderstorm. It occurs to them that there has been a violent storm in the past few days. The sound of the thunder is heard by several nearby residents. A horsemen appears near them, which indicates that it is time for another storm. As dawn breaks, Brocksheba emerges from the shelter dressed in her wedding dress. She informs everyone that she has married Troy. At this moment, Oak arrives with a packet containing gold coins belonging to Jane Eyre. This money will enable them to save their property until the next day. It begins to rain, and as a result of the heavy downpour, it becomes very difficult for Gabriel to get his hands on the sheaves. He tries to finish the job he has started, but is unsuccessful in doing so. The following day, Bathheba tells her husband that she will not be able to go riding with him next week due to the weather. She also says that she does not want to lose the money they have earned from horseback riding. They agree to meet again the following Monday morning at ten o'clock. At this point, Frank rushes up to them and asks if there is anything he can do for them. There is, indeed, a sign posted on the wall outside the Union House: ""Fanny Robin's head."" It turns out that Fanny had been working as a housekeeper before she was married to Captain Donnithorne, who died after a long illness during the Civil War. In order to help her cope with the loss of her beloved lover, Bathherba suggests that they set up a meeting place for the couple to discuss their future together. The next morning, Gabriel Oak appears at the inn. He tells Bathheba that he has heard a rumor that Fannish Robin has been found dead and is being buried in a nearby hollow. The narrator notes that this news displeases Bathshebias sense of obligation toward her husband. As she waits for Liddy to arrive, she realizes that it is time for Fanny to be buried. She hurries back to the farmhouse where she will hide out until Liddy returns with a coffin containing Fanny's body. When they return home, however, there is no one there to tell them what has happened. They are all very confused as to why they have come upon such a desolate place The Gurgoyle: Its DOINGS Troy waits to see if Fanny will keep her promise, but she does not. He goes to the graveyard and finds a grave with a snowdrop-shaped headstone and a half-finished marble footstone. The tomb is filled with flowers and plants that have been planted in the past few years on the spot where Fanny was buried. A local newspaper article reports that Troy has drowned while swimming near his wife's grave. This news upsets Liddy because he thinks it might be time for him to take up his new bailiff position. Bathheba takes advantage of this opportunity to visit her family at their farm, where she meets Liddy who informs her that her husband has drowned as a result of an accidental drowning. She also learns from Liddy that they are going to pay a large sum of money to find a way to help them both financially. The next day, a traveling circus performs at the Fairgrounds. Many people are there to witness the performance; some of them even recognize Troy as the man behind the tent who is supposed to be directing the show. The circus manager sees his wife waiting for him and tells her that she should go along with the performance because it will give her an opportunity to meet Boldwood in person. She agrees but does not want to hear any more details about the matter. Later, on Christmas Eve, they have a party at the bachelor pad owned by Mr. Bulstrode, who has just been laid off from his job. He asks if Bathheba will marry him or not, and when she says yes, he makes two small cuts in the fabric around her neck so that she can't feel the warmth of his touch. After the party ends, Oak comes into the tent looking for someone else to help him tie up his coat. When he arrives, he finds out that Mrs. Bess has already agreed to allow him to do whatever he wants during the evening while he is gone. They decide to part ways after all Boldwood returns to his house. He finds a woman's finger ring with diamonds on it, which he promptly drops in the pocket of his jacket as he prepares to leave for work. The men are shocked to learn that Troy has been seen approaching Boldwood's house and that he is about to go inside to see if anyone will recognize him there. A group of them then goes inside to find out what time it is. They do not want to hear any more details because they know that Bathheba does not approve of their plan. She tells them that she wants to marry them immediately so that no one will suspect her of anything. At this point, Dr. Oak arrives at the scene and informs everyone that someone has been found dead in the family home. This person is identified only as Bill Trotwood, who has pleaded guilty and sentenced to life in prison after failing to provide adequate medical care during the trial. After being locked up for several days, Phoebe comes down the chimney from the porch looking for her mistress. As she looks around, she realizes that she has lost sight of her former self. advertisement",3.233762703414855,0.2741823194181608
Measure for Measure," Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna, makes it known that he intends to leave the city on a diplomatic mission. He leaves the government in the hands of a strict judge, Angelo. Claudio, a young nobleman, is betrothed/unofficially married to Juliet. At the time, marriages were supposed to be announced by banns in advance. Due to lack of money, Claudio and Juliet did not observe all the technicalities. This did not make them unique however; at the time most people (including the Church) would have considered them married. Technically, however, all the formalities for a civil marriage had not been followed and so a strict judge might rule that they were not legally married. Angelo, as the personification of the law, decides to enforce the ruling that fornication is punishable by death, and since he does not accept the validity of the marriage, Claudio is sentenced to be executed. Claudio's friend, Lucio, visits Claudio's sister, Isabella, a novice nun, and asks her to intercede with Angelo on Claudio's behalf. Isabella obtains an audience with Angelo, and pleads for mercy for Claudio. Over the course of two scenes between Angelo and Isabella, it becomes clear that he harbours lustful thoughts about her, and he eventually offers her a deal: Angelo will spare Claudio's life if Isabella yields him her virginity. Isabella refuses, but she also realises that (due to Angelo's austere reputation) she will not be believed if she makes a public accusation against him. Instead she visits her brother in prison and counsels him to prepare himself for death. Claudio vehemently begs Isabella to save his life, but Isabella refuses. As a novice nun, she feels that she cannot sacrifice her own immortal soul (and that of Claudio's, if he causes her to lose her virtue) to save Claudio's transient earthly life. The Duke has not in fact left the city, but remains there disguised as a friar (Lodowick) in order to spy on the city's affairs, and especially on the actions of Angelo. In his guise as a friar he befriends Isabella and arranges two tricks to thwart Angelo's evil intentions: #First, a ""bed trick"" is arranged. Angelo has previously refused to fulfill the betrothal binding him to Mariana, because her dowry had been lost at sea. Isabella sends word to Angelo that she has decided to submit to him, making it a condition of their meeting that it occurs in perfect darkness and in silence. Mariana agrees to take Isabella's place, and she has sex with Angelo, although he continues to believe he has enjoyed Isabella. (In some interpretations of the law, this constitutes consummation of their betrothal, and therefore their marriage. This is the same interpretation that assumes that Claudio and Juliet are legally married.) #After having sex with Mariana (who he thinks is Isabella), Angelo goes back on his word, sending a message to the prison that he wishes to see Claudio's head, and necessitating the ""head trick."" The Duke first attempts to arrange the execution of another prisoner whose head can be sent instead of Claudio's. However, the villain Barnardine refuses to be executed in his drunken state. As luck would have it, a pirate named Ragozine, of similar appearance to Claudio, has recently died of a fever, so his head is sent to Angelo instead. This main plot concludes with the 'return' to Vienna of the Duke as himself. Isabella and Mariana publicly petition him, and he hears their claims against Angelo, which Angelo smoothly denies. As the scene develops, it appears that Friar Lodowick will be blamed for the 'false' accusations levelled against Angelo. The Duke leaves Angelo to judge the cause against Lodowick, but returns in disguise moments later when Lodowick is summoned. Eventually the friar reveals himself to be the Duke, thereby exposing Angelo as a liar and Isabella and Mariana as truthful. He proposes that Angelo be executed but first compels him to marry Mariana— with his estate going to Mariana as her new dowry, ""to buy you a better husband"". Mariana pleads for Angelo's life, even enlisting the aid of Isabella (who is not yet aware her brother Claudio is still living). The Duke pretends not to heed the women's petition, and only after revealing that Claudio has not, in fact, been executed, relents. The Duke then proposes marriage to Isabella. Isabella does not reply, and her reaction is interpreted differently in different productions: her silent acceptance of his proposal is the most common in performance. This is one of the ""open silences"" of the play. A sub-plot concerns Claudio's friend Lucio, who frequently slanders the duke to the friar, and in the last act slanders the friar to the duke, providing opportunities for comic consternation on Vincentio's part and landing Lucio in trouble when it is revealed that the duke and the friar are one and the same. His punishment, like Angelo's, is to be forced into an undesired marriage: in this case with the prostitute Kate Keepdown.

Next up is a prison sent by Angelo disguised as Friar Elbow. In this scene, Angelo tells Isabella that he has been imprisoned for helping Claudio escape from his jail cell. He also says that if Claudio dies, Angelo plans to send him back to prison himself. The servant arrives and tells Angelo that Claudio cannot live because he has been sentenced to death for his adulterous affair with Juliet. Angelo asks the servant if there is any way to pardon Claudio without causing him pain. The servant responds by saying, ""If I should die, then why would I let this brother die?"" This makes Angelo even more furious. Isabella explains that she wants to die so that she will be able to marry Claudio in exchange for Angelo's forgiveness. She also says that her plan is to kill Claudio the next morning at 4:00 a.m. on the following day. At this point, the Provost enters disguised as Friar Poypey and announces that they have obtained an execution warrant from Angelo. He instructs them to set up a meeting place where Claudio can be killed. They are off to meet Angelo later that day. advertisement",0.4148607420740006,0.2251851804488341
The Scapegoat," 'I left the car by the side of the cathedral, and then walked down the steps into the Place des Jacobins. It was still raining hard. It had not once let up since Tours, and all I had seen of the countryside I loved was the gleaming surface of the route nationale, rhythmically cut by the monotonous swing of the windscreen-wiper. Outside Le Mans, the depression that had grown upon me during the past twenty-fours had intensified.' (p.1) The Scapegoat is narrated by John, an Englishman and lecturer in French history at a London university, who is coming to the end of his holiday in France. He arrives in Le Mans, depressed and melancholy at the thought of returning to his lectures: 'the real meaning of history would have escaped me, because I had never been close enough to people' (p.1). John feels lonely, isolated, and as though his outward life is a meaningless facade. 'I lived and breathed and had my being as a law-abiding, quiet, donnish individual of thirty-eight. But to the self who clamoured for release, the man within? How did my poor record seem to him? [...] Perhaps, if I had not kept him locked within me, he might have laughed, roistered, fought and lied' (p.10). John considers concluding his visit at the Abbaye de la Grande-Trappe where he hopes to find some consolation but as he crosses the road in Le Mans the driver of a car calls out to him, addressing him as Jean. John tries to explain to the man who seems to know him that there has been a mistake but the man takes it to be a deliberate deception, winks, laughs and drives away. He enters the station buffet and is confronted by another man: 'I realised, with a strange sense of shock and fear and nausea all combined, that his face and voice were known to me too well. I was looking at myself' (p.13). John has a premonition that meeting his double could be 'fraught with tragedy, like the Man in the Iron Mask' (p.14) but he sits down and has a drink with his doppelganger, to whom he begins to confess his feelings of depression and failure. His double mistakes him for a Frenchman because of his excellent grasp of the language and they eventually retire to a backstreet hotel where they continue to drink and eventually swap clothes. John falls to the floor drunk and when he awakes, he discovers a chauffeur at the door: 'Monsieur le Comte is awake at last?' (p.27). John realises that his double has disappeared with his clothing and he attempts to convince the chauffeur that he is not the Comte. The chauffeur believes him to be drunk and when he enquires after the 'gentleman I was with last night' (p.30) the hotel receptionist has no knowledge of him. John decides that if 'he wished to make an idiot of me, I would do the same to him. I would put on his clothes and drive his car to hell - as he was no doubt driving mine - and have myself arrested, and then wait for him to turn up and explain his senseless action as best he could' (p.31). Ignoring further opportunities to explain his predicament, John shaves, dresses, gets in the car and they make for the chateau at St Gilles. He realises that Jean de Gué 'had given me what I asked, the chance to be accepted. He had lent me his name, his possessions, his identity. I had told him my own life was empty: he had given me his' (p.34). They arrive at the chateau and John is met by a man named Paul, Jean's brother, who appears irritated by his lateness. John enters the house and goes into a room in which three women are seated. One, named Blanche, leaves as soon as he enters; the second, a fair-haired woman, who is pregnant, tells him that they have been worried about his absence; and the third, dark-haired, exchanges a knowing glance with him. The women inform him that Marie-Noel has a fever and when asked about Paris he declares carelessly: 'I have no idea what happened in Paris. I'm suffering from memory loss' (p.41). The pregnant woman expresses her hope that he has reached an agreement in Paris but John continues to taunt the women: 'Actually, I am not Jean de Gué at all. I am someone else. We met in Le Mans last night, and changed clothes, and he has disappeared in my car, heaven knows where, and I am here in his place. You must admit it's an extraordinary situation' (p.42). The women take no notice, believing him to be suffering from a hangover, and eventually John admits that he drank too much in Le Mans and leaves the room. Venturing upstairs, John finds himself in a bare room decorated only with religious paraphernalia: a painting of the scourging of Christ, a crucifix, and a small alcove for prayer. A servant discovers him and asks, looking rather surprised, if he is searching for Mademoiselle Blanche. He is told that she is with the Madame la Comtesse who is eager to see him and will not wait. He follows the servant into a room in which 'a massive elderly women, her flesh sagging in a hundred lines, but her eyes, her nose, her mouth so astonishingly and horribly like my own that for one wild moment I believed after all Jean de Gué had come up here before me and was masquerading as a final jest' (p.46). John intuits that the woman is Jean's mother and when she presses him as to whether he has renewed the contract; he tells her that everything has been arranged. She pesters him for a present that he has brought her from Paris and then they dine. She tells him that Marie-Noel has been having visions and that 'she kept telling Françoise and Renée that you were not coming back' (p.52). Blanche, who has been sitting with Madame la Comtesse while the local priest attended her, declares that she will inform the bishop if Marie-Noel continues to have visions of the Virgin Mary. The mother's maid, Charlotte, presses John for the package and he leaves the room, fortuitously stumbling upon Jean's dressing room where he discovers a number of parcels, marked F, R, B, P, M-N, and Maman. He returns with the parcel but Charlotte intercepts it and takes it away. When he returns to the dressing room he discovers that the pregnant woman is Françoise and that rather than being Paul's wife, as he had assumed, she is in fact Jean's wife. John gives her the package marked 'F' which turns out to be a locket brooch containing a miniature of himself/Jean. Françoise is pleased but confesses her deep unhappiness to John. When she falls asleep, John goes out into the corridors of the chateau and is accosted by Renée, the dark haired woman, who says: 'I waited for you, leaving my door open. Didn't you see it?' (p.64). John brushes her off and she storms away upstairs. He goes out onto the terrace at the back of the house and is suddenly pelted by chestnuts, by a kneeling figure in an upstairs window. He looks closer and discovers that it is a child who declares: 'I swear to you, that if you don't come to me by the time I count a hundred, I shall throw myself out of the window' (p.67). John rushes inside and finds the child, who looks like Jean de Gué in miniature and calls him 'Papa'; the child is Marie-Noel. She is affectionate and playful with him but notices that his hands and smell are different. She tells him that she had a vision of the Virgin Mary who told her that her father would not return. She declares that she would have killed herself if he had not returned: 'And then I should have burnt in hell. But I would rather burn in hell than live in this world without you' (p.71). Her room, like Blanche's, also contains a crucifix, a prie-dieu, and pictures of the saints. John returns to his bedroom and opens the package marked M-N, it is a book called 'The Little Flower' about St Therese Lisieux. John thinks that Jean acted wrongly to escape from the chateau- 'none of these people under his roof would be behaving as they had behaved tonight but for something he had done to them' (p.76)-but he sees an opportunity for himself to put it right. When John awakes the next morning, Gaston tells him that Paul will be expecting him at the verrerie (the glass-works) in the afternoon. John gives Marie-Noel her present and declares that he will give all the other presents at lunchtime, although Marie-Noel is surprised that there is one for Blanche. At lunch, the content of Renée's package- a lace nightgown- upsets the party and there is further embarrassment when Marie-Noel reads the label on Paul's present- a remedy for impotence. Blanche does not open her parcel. John realises his mistake and leaves with Paul for the verrerie. He apologises for the mistake but Paul remains furious. At the verrerie, John discovers that the reason for Jean's visit to Paris was to attempt to save the business by renegotiating a contract with a firm called Carvalet to sell their glass. Despite having no idea as to the outcome of Jean's meeting, John tells Paul that he has renewed the contract and that production can continue as normal. Paul is delighted. John interrogates Jacques who works at the foundry and discovers that the verrerie is a liability and that unlike Jean's father, and Monsieur Duval who managed affairs previously, the Comte's management of the business has been non-existent. He then meets some of the workers at the foundry including Julie and her son-in-law André who had been badly injured in an accident. Back at the chateau, John reads the letter from Carvalet and discovers that they had declined to renew the contract and that the visit to Paris had been a failure. John decides to rectify the situation. He rings Carvalet and tells them that he will accept their terms, despite running the verrerie at a loss. He suspects that someone has overheard his phone call but he cannot locate the other extension. He rummages through Jean's desk in search of some information about his finances but instead finds a photograph album featuring himself, Paul, and Blanche as children, and a man named Maurice. Renée comes into the library and berates him for giving her the lingerie at the dinner table. John suddenly realises that Jean was having an affair with her and he attempts again to brush her off. He goes to see Marie-Noel and discovers that Blanche had opened her package. Inside was a bottle of perfume and a note: 'For my beautiful Béla, from Jean'. Marie-Noel also lets slip in conversation that Jean had not spoken to Blanche in fifteen years and John muses: 'no wonder the giving of a present had been out of character. The revelation was disturbing, even sinister, especially when I remembered the snapshots of the two children with their arms about each other. Something personal and bitter had come between Blanche and Jean de Gué, yet it was accepted by all, even by the child' (p.127). When John puts Marie-Noel to bed she tells him that she had sinned by threatening to kill herself and she attempts to perform penance by beating herself with a leather whip. Appalled by the effects which Blanche's religion is having on his daughter, John delivers the whip back to her only to find the door slammed in his face. John decides to spend his second night at the chateau sleeping in the dressing room. 'I knew that everything I had said or done had implicated me further, driven me deeper, bound me more closely still to that man whose body was not my body, whose mind was not my mind, whose thoughts and actions were a world apart, and yet whose inner substance was part of my nature, part of my secret self' (p.138). The next morning John decides to go to the bank in Villars to investigate his double's finances. Renée contrives to go with him but John encourages Marie-Noel to join the party. Marie-Noel is delighted but when doing cartwheels in her mother's room, smashes two ornaments. Françoise is upset and lashes out at the child, telling her that when the baby arrives, she will take second place. John takes the pieces of the ornaments with him, parcelled up in some discarded paper he found in the dressing room, hoping to arrange for them to be mended in Villars. Renée is annoyed that she and Jean/John are to be chaperoned by the child and she goes off to the hairdressers. Marie-Noel visits the antique shop to see if they can fix the ornaments while Jean goes to the bank. In his vault he discovers the marriage settlement relating to Jean and Françoise. He discovers that Françoise's dowry was in trust for a male heir and that Jean would only come into the money otherwise if Françoise reached the age of fifty having only given birth to daughters or if she died. John understands why it is crucial for Françoise's baby to be a boy and why she is anxious about the pregnancy. John leaves the bank, having been told that Marie-Noel had already left town in a lorry going back to the verrerie. He goes over to speak to the blonde woman who he presumes owns the antique shop where Marie-Noel left the ornaments. She ushers him inside and declares: 'That child of yours is adorable but it was very naughty of you to send her here. Any why for heaven's sake did you wrap up those pieces of broken porcelain in cellophane and paper with a card addressed to me?' (p.155). John inadvertently wrapped the pieces in the paper containing the note to 'Béla' from Jean. He realises that this woman in Villars is Béla and she is another of the Comte's mistresses. John tells Béla the truth about the Carvalet contract and she asks him why the sudden concern for the verrerie and its workforce. She tells him that she has always wondered whether his lack of interest in the place was because of what happened to Maurice Duval. John encourages her to keep talking and she mentions that he died during the Occupation. He tries to tell her about the change that has come over him/Jean and that he is a different person. Béla replies 'you aren't the only one with a dual personality. We all have multiple selves. But no one avoids responsibility that way. The problems remain to be tackled just the same' (p.164). When John returns to the house, he discovers that the doctor who had called to see Françoise has already left and he has ordered her to remain in bed in order to protect the baby. He goes to talk to Françoise and tells her that he had a long meeting at the bank which prevented him from being home in time, and he confesses about the Carvalet contract. Françoise is pleased that he confided in her and she then asks if he looked at the marriage settlement when he was in the vault. He says that he did and she asks whether he will inherit the money if she dies. '""What happens if I die? You get everything, don't you?"" ""You're not going to die""' (p.172). John goes to see Jean's mother and when he mentions that perhaps Françoise should see a specialist if the pregnancy is going to present problems, she says slyly 'Whatever for?' (p.176). They are interrupted by a telephone call from Dr Lebrun. He tells John that Françoise needs complete rest. Marie-Noel asks why the servants are gossiping about the baby dying and she asks why they need to have another baby. John replies honestly that it is because of the money they will receive from the marriage settlement. John returns upstairs to sit with Françoise rather than brave Paul and Renée in the salon. She is touched, if a little surprised, by the concern. The following day he goes down to the verrerie to go through the figures with Jacques in the office and he then asks about the rest of the disused house. He finds a box of books, one of which is inscribed 'Maurice Duval', and he asks Jacques why they don't make the house inhabitable. He replies that 'there are not very happy memories connected with the house when it was last inhabited. Few people would wish to live there now [...] When the last man to live here, the master of the verrerie, Monsieur Duval, is woken from his bed in the middle of the night, and taken downstairs and shot by his own countrymen, and his body thrown into the well cut to pieces with his own glass, even if it happened a long time ago and is something we all prefer to forget, yet it does not make anybody very anxious to come and live here, where it happened, bringing a wife and family' (p.189). John signs the new contract from Carvalet and puts it in the post. He then goes to talk to Julie and asks her about the Occupation. She shows him a snapshot of a young German officer whose coat she cleaned so that he would not get in trouble with his superiors. The villagers ostracised her two years afterwards: 'so you see, when war comes to one's own village, one's own doorstep, it isn't tragic and impersonal any longer. It's just an excuse to vomit private hatred' (p.194). When he returns to the chateau, the servants ask John about the arrangements for the annual shoot the following day. He has overheard references to the 'grande chasse' during the past few days but he suddenly realises its implications: he, John, cannot shoot. He goes out into the grounds of the chateau, desperate for an excuse not to participate. He sees a fire burning and decides on a rash course of action. He drops Jean's watch into the fire and then thrusts his hand into the flames to retrieve it. He returns inside in great pain, to the shock of the family, especially when they discover that the watch he had wished to save had been a present from Maurice Duval. Blanche dresses the wound and he tells Paul to organise the shoot; now he is injured, he has no interest in it. When he goes to put Marie-Noel to bed, she tells him that she saw him thrusting his hand into the fire on purpose. He tells her that it was because he had not wanted to shoot and she says that he must have been thinking about Duval. When John questions her further she says that she knows he met a horrible death, but that her grandmother had forbidden her from talking about Duval either to her father or to Blanche. She asks if he did it because he didn't want to kill any birds, and when he says that perhaps that was the reason, she is pleased at his courage and his 'great act of humiliation' (p.216). John persuades her not to mention it to any one and Marie-Noel agrees, although she tells him that she thinks his act to be like the sacrificial mortifications of the saints. When the annual shoot begins the next day, John discovers Jean's mother welcoming the guests, who are so surprised by her emergence from the chateau that John's hand goes unnoticed. John is annoyed when she mocks Paul and Renée's attempts to run the shoot but he then finds himself unable to control Jean's dog, César. The dog scatters the birds, to Paul's annoyance, and John returns to the chateau with Gaston, drinking cognac from a hip flask. He meets the man who first mistook him for Jean in Le Mans before the swop took place and on a whim he gives the man his own address in London: '""Any assistance you give this chap you'll be giving to me; we're closer than brothers."" Then I burst out laughing, thinking him extremely stupid not to see the point' (p.229). John is encouraged to give a speech to the guests, which despite his inebriation he does, but they are not amused when he jokes that if he had shot with his damaged hand 'some of you present might never have survived' (p.230). When he returns to the chateau, John is summoned to Jean's mother who appears to be unwell. Her maid is downstairs in the kitchen and the mother urges him to help her, directing him to a drawer. When John opens it he discovers that the package which he brought back from Paris was ampoules of morphine. 'But his mother was not ill or dying, neither was she in pain' (p.234). He reluctantly administers the drug and she loses consciousness. John spends the night in Villars with Béla. He recounts the events of the day and when he recalls his quip about the gun she comments: 'Coming from a one-time Resistance leader to a group of well-known collaborators, it must have sounded curious all the same' (p.245). When he returns to the chateau he discovers a letter from Marie-Noel pushed under his door in which she writes: 'The Sainte Vierge tells me you are unhappy, and are suffering now for wrong done in the past, so I am going to pray that all your sins may be visited upon me, who, being young and strong, can bear them better.' (p.248). When he goes in to Françoise, she tells him that Marie-Noel has disappeared. Everyone goes out to look for Marie-Noel except Françoise. By chance John discovers her down at the house at the verrerie being looked after by Julie, who found her down the well amongst the broken glass after the dog, César, was found there barking. When he expresses surprise about the well and that it has contained no water for fifteen years, he finally discovers the secret of Jean's past. Maurice Duval was shot by Jean and his men: 'poor Monsieur Duval, whose only crime was trying to preserve the verrerie while you were absent, for which you and your little group of patriots called him a collaborator, and shot him, and let him die there in the well' (p.258). John's realises that Marie-Noel had climbed into the well as an act of penitence on behalf of her father. Blanche arrives and looks around her at the house and John suddenly realises that 'what she was looking at had once been part of her life' (p.260): Blanche had had a relationship with Duval. Marie-Noel wakes up and tells John that she had had a dream in which the Virgin Mary told her that her grandmother wanted Françoise to die: 'In the dream I wanted her to die too. So did you. We were all guilty. It was very wicked. Isn't there something you can do to prevent it coming true?' (p.263). At that moment there is a telephone call from the chateau for John to return at once. Françoise has fallen from the bedroom window and been taken to the hospital in Villars. She requires a blood transfusion and when Blanche says that either Jean or Paul could donate because they are the same blood type, John speaks up and denies it. Blanche declares: 'You don't want to save her. You're hoping she'll die' (p.269). Françoise and her baby, which was a boy, both die and John thinks back on his behaviour towards Jean's wife. He is glad he gave her the locket but he regrets that he had done no more. Back at the chateau, John interrogates his mother's maid Charlotte. She says that when Marie-Noel had gone missing, Françoise worried that 'the child might have turned against her. She is too fond of her papa, she said, and of Mademoiselle Blanche' (p.275). Charlotte tells John that she agreed with Françoise and he worries about how this might have affected her. He goes to the bedroom and leans out of the window, wondering whether her death can really have been an accident. Fearing the worst, John goes to interrogate Jean's mother. He forces her into recounting a conversation which she had with Françoise shortly before she died. Madame la Comtesse recalls: '""Does he want me to die so that he can marry someone else?"" she [Françoise] asked at last. I told her I did not know. ""Jean makes love to everyone. He has made love to Renée, even, here in the chateau, and he has a mistress in Villars"" [...] ""So the child isn't the only one to want me out of the way,"" she said, ""Jean does, too, and so do you, and Renée, and the woman in Villars."" I didn't answer her.' (p.283). Jean's mother concludes by saying 'You've got what you wanted, haven't you?' (p.283) but John denies it vehemently. He declares that he needs her help and after considerable effort, he persuades her to resume her position at the head of the family and to give up the morphine. She agrees and goes downstairs to begin making the funeral arrangements. The commissaire de police arrives to investigate Françoise's death. The suspicion of suicide is raised and when Charlotte is interviewed, she lets slip that she had been listening in to John's conversation with Carvalet about the renewal of the contract. Paul is astonished. When the commissaire goes to Françoise's bedroom Marie-Noel is there, having leant out the window and discovered the locket on the ledge. It seems that when leaning out to rescue Jean's present, Françoise fell. Paul confronts John about the Carvalet contract and he tells him the truth. John admits that he/Jean has no head for business and he agrees with Paul that if he had gone to Paris instead, the contract would no doubt have been more favourable. John suggests that Paul take over that part of the business and travel with Renée, while he stays at the chateau. Paul is surprised but he accepts, believing it to be the only way to save his marriage. Later when Renée confronts him, John says that he is not in love with her. She asks him whether he contrived the Carvalet contract in the hope that Françoise would die, and is relieved when he denies the charge. John sits with Jean's mother until she falls asleep as she is beginning to suffer withdrawal symptoms from the morphine. He then goes to see Blanche and while she dresses his hand, he forces her to talk about the past. He tries to apologise but Blanche is still angry, reminding him of his mockery of her and Duval's relationship, and his jealousy when their father made Duval head of the verrerie. John tells Blanche that he wants her to run the verrerie in his place and to live in the master's house. 'The house is waiting there for you. It's been waiting for fifteen years.' (p.326). The next day the funeral arrangements are begun, Blanche goes down to the verrerie, and Renée begins to talk about travelling with Paul. Then there is a telephone call for John. It is Jean de Gué: 'It's me. Jean de Gué. I've just seen today's newspaper. I'm coming back' (p.334). They agree to meet at the master's house at the verrerie. 'Although the emotion that filled me now was violent, over-whelming, yet at the same time I felt deliberate and calm. I was the possessor now, he the intruder. The chateau was my chateau, the people were my people, the family who in a few minutes would sit with me round the table were my family, my flesh and blood; they belonged to me and I to them. He could not return and make them his again' (p.336). John goes into the library and removes a revolver from the desk drawer. He waits in the master's house but when there is a knock at the door, he finds the priest standing there, who takes the gun from his hand. The priest had feared that John might kill himself and he says: 'What good would that do, to you or to them? By living, you can create their world afresh. Already I see signs of it, here in the master's house' (p.343). When the priest leaves, Jean de Gué enters holding a gun and says 'So you planned to get rid of me, did you, and stay in St Gilles?' (p.345). Jean is amazed that John has managed to keep up the deception for seven days and he amuses himself by wondering how John dealt with his various intrigues, and problems with Renée, with Blanche, with Françoise. He mocks John's attempt to take his mother off morphine: 'tonight she'll be a raving maniac', and he thinks that John's plan for Renée and Paul will break up their marriage even sooner: 'Renée will find the lover she's been searching for and Paul feel himself more inferior than ever [...] What want of tact, if I may say so, how lacking in finesse' (pp.347-8). He is more concerned with the Carvalet contract but considers that asking Blanche to run the verrerie might in fact make sound business sense. Jean thinks that John wants to stay at the chateau for the money and comfort, but John says 'I happen to love your family, that's all' (p.349). Jean laughs in disbelief that he could love them, listing their faults: 'Paul, who is an oaf, a weakling, a thoroughly disagreeable personality [...] Blanche, who is so twisted with repressed sex and frustrated passion that the only stimulation she gets out of life is to kneel before a bleeding crucifix' (p.350). John tells Jean to kill him, if that is his wish, and to throw him down the well. Jean is surprised that he has discovered the secret about Duval. He believes that John could not possibly have met Béla, and John does not disabuse him of this notion. He then tells John that during his time in the chateau, he had been to London. Jean stayed in his flat and then sold it, clearing out his bank account and changing the money into francs after fortuitously meeting up with his friend from Le Mans, to whom John had given his London address during the annual shoot. John is astounded: 'unless I liked to make a fool of myself by writing to the university and saying it was all a mistake - that I had decided not to resign after all - I had no work. I had no money, save for one or two investments. I had no flat, and if I didn't get back to London soon I should have no furniture. I did not exist. The self who had lived in London had gone forever' (p.355). Jean admits that in a strange way he missed his family, and the two exchange clothes. Jean suggests that they might make the switch again, from time to time, if they fancied a change. They get into John's car and drive towards the chateau. He tries to tell Jean that his family has changed, but he ignores him. Jean gets out of the car and walks the rest of the way and John sees him greet Marie-Noel as he drives on along the road. John drives to Villars to see Béla. She alone had realised that he was someone else and not the real Jean de Gué. She says that he had a 'tendresse' that Jean did not possess. She says that because of John the family in the chateau will be different, even if Jean tries to undo the good he has done there. John says that Jean is a 'devil' but Béla replies: 'he's not a devil. He's a human, ordinary man, just like yourself' (p.364). She tells him that 'you've given something to all of us [...] Just now I called it tendresse. Whatever it is, it can't be destroyed. It's taken root. It will go on growing. In the future we shall look for you in Jean, not for Jean in you' (pp.364-5). John says that at St Gilles his failure turned into love but 'the problem remains the same. What do I do with love?' (p.367). He leaves resolving to follow his original path to the Abbey de la Grande Trappe. 'I drove to the network of roads at the top of the town, turned left, and took the road to Bellême and Mortagne' (p.368).
","In this chapter, Maples explains how he came to be involved in a sensationalist newspaper story about ""juvenile delinquency"" by reporting on the arrest of Tommy. He says that Jones had advised him to stop writing such sensationalist articles because it would lead to more crime and corruption in the town. But Nan sees through his story and tells him not to worry--she's going to keep her job. The next morning, Ted goes to see Mr. Thompson, who informs him that they have arrested one of Tommy's former schoolmates for shoplifting. They've released both Tommy and their son from jail but won't tell anyone else what happened until after the fact. In order to clear up any misunderstandings, Ted has to use all of his legal expertise to get out of trouble. Also, he has to give Nan some money if she wants to go back to work as a journalist. When Ted gets home, he finds Nan sobbing and yelling at him like a banshee. She tries to comfort him, telling him that he can do whatever he wants without having to explain anything to her or anyone else. Eventually, though, Ted is able to figure out where Ashe might be hiding.",1.9031258805733248e-11,0.10140844915691333
The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck," The tale begins in a farmyard which is home to a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs. At the top of a hill, she spies a distant wood, flies to it, and waddles about until she discovers an appropriate nesting place. However, a charming gentleman with ""black prick ears and sandy-coloured whiskers"" persuades her to nest in a shed at his home. Jemima is led to his ""tumble-down shed"" (which is curiously filled with feathers), and makes herself a nest with little ado. Jemima lays her eggs, and the fox suggests a dinner party to mark the event. He asks her to collect the traditional herbs used in stuffing a duck, telling her the seasonings will be used for an omelette. Jemima sets about her errand, but the farm collie, Kep, meets her as she carries onions from the farm kitchen. She reveals her errand, and Kep sees through the fox's plan at once. With the help of two fox-hound puppies, Kep rescues Jemima and the ""foxy-whiskered gentleman"" is chased away and never seen again. However, the hungry fox-hounds eat Jemima's eggs. Jemima is escorted back to the farm in tears over her lost eggs, but, in time, lays more eggs and successfully hatches four ducklings.

The Land of Little Rain," The Land of Little Rain is a collection of short stories and essays detailing the landscape and inhabitants of the American Southwest. A message of environmental conservation and a philosophy of cultural and sociopolitical regionalism loosely links the stories together. ;""The Land of Little Rain"" The opening essay describes the ""Country of Lost Borders,"" an area of land between Death Valley and the High Sierras. The image created of the land at the beginning of the story is one of almost unbearable heat and dryness, punctuated by violent storms. Despite the description of how inhospitable the landscape is, at the end Austin proposes that the costs the land imposes upon a man are worth it because it provides man with peace of mind and body that cannot be achieved any other way. ;""Water Trails of the Ceriso"" The section's title refers to the trails made by wild animals moving towards sources of water. The essay provides descriptions of the many animals that travel along the trails, including coyotes, rabbits, and quails. Their ability to find water where there seems to be none is extolled by Austin, a skill which she believes no human is able to match. ;""The Scavengers"" This essay describes the various animals that live in the desert that feed upon carrion&mdash;most notably, the buzzards and the carrion crows. This scavenging is portrayed as a natural part of the desert, with a multitude of the scavengers working together to find food. The end of the story criticizes the actions of man with regard to the desert. The unnatural trash he leaves cannot used by the scavengers in the story, and as such serves as a stark contrast to the desert's natural processes for recycling waste. ;""The Pocket Hunter"" A pocket hunter is a type of miner who hunts for pockets of ore deposits. In the story, the pocket hunter described by Mary Austin lives off of the land with minimal interactions with the civilized world. This harmony with nature, Austin argues, is essential to the pocket hunter's simple happiness. Despite Austin's muted praise, the pocket hunter wants to strike it rich in order to move to Europe and mingle with the landed elite, a goal he accomplishes. However, by the end of the story, the pocket hunter returns to the desert since it is his ""destiny"". ;""Shoshone Land"" ""Shoshone Land"" narrates the experiences of Winnenap', an American Indian medicine man originally from Shoshone Land who was captured by the Paiute tribe. The story initially revolves around Winnenap', but quickly changes to a detailed description of the environment and wildlife of Shoshone Land to form an intimate tie between Winnenap' and the land he formerly inhabited. ;""Jimville&mdash;a Bret Harte Town"" In the beginning of the section, Jimville is touted as a better source of inspiration for Bret Harte than he found during his own travels. Jimville's inhabitants are likened to the fictional characters that were present in some of Harte's short stories. Austin portrays Jimville as a small town set in a harsh environment and inhabited by simple yet endearing toughs. Although the inhabitants endure many hardships, Austin claims that there is an almost unexplainable pull which keeps them in town and encourages new travelers to stay. ;""My Neighbor's Field"" The story is about a plot of land which changes hands many times&mdash;Austin characterizes this plot of land as an ideal field. She criticizes the owners of the field, the Indians and shepherds, because their habits and lifestyle scar the land. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that the field is destined to develop into an urban area. Austin claims that while the field may at that point serve a greater human use, it will not be better for the land and all life. ;""The Mesa Trail"" This section describes one of the trails that runs through the American Southwest. It contains several passages detailing the damage human activity has done to the land. She criticizes the ""unsightly scars"" left by the Paiute Indians in the form of abandoned campoodies and the damaged plant life left by domesticated animals such as sheep. ;""The Basket Maker"" This story follows the life of Seyavi, a Paiute Indian who loses her mate, lives alone with her child, and sells baskets she weaves in order to survive. Austin claims that the Paiutes make the land itself their home, with the natural ridges of mountains as walls and the wild almond bloom as their furnishings. It is because of this that Austin argues that the Paiutes will always be homesick when in homes built by man, as man cannot replicate nature's walls and furnishings. ;""The Streets of the Mountains"" This essay consists of long description of mountains and their respective trails. The section characterizes the beauty of the mountains and their inhabitants. The story also contains critiques people who dwell in man-made houses. The comfort provided by such houses, Austin argues, results in people not being able to truly understand the beauty and divinity of the mountains. ;""Water Borders"" The essay revolves around the streams and lakes that can be found in the mountains, generally formed from the melting snow higher in the mountains. The particular mountain in the story is Oppapago, a mountain within the Sierras in a forest reserve. Austin contrasts the mountain landscape to a meadow outside a forest reserve, which lacks color and beauty because it is damaged by the grazing of sheep. ;""Other Water Borders"" ""Other Water Borders"" is centered more on the plants affected by the water from the mountains, both wild and cultivated. The story begins with a depiction of a squabble between several locals over an irrigation ditch filled by water from the mountains. This is followed by a series of descriptions of the variety of plants that the irrigation ditch allows to thrive. Found within these depictions of plant life is Austin's lament of the complexities of civilization. Austin implies that with the advent of cities and manufactured objects people have lost an innate ability to know what natural remedies may be beneficial or detrimental to one's health. ;""Nurslings of the Sky"" The ""nurslings of the sky"" are storms, formed in the hills and given almost human characteristics by Austin. The beginning of the story contains an account of the destruction of a town by floods and snow. The blame for the events is not placed on nature, but rather the people whose poorly placed town was destroyed. The story continues with descriptions of storms and their effects upon the wildlife of the area, pausing to explain how the land teaches people things. The story uses the example of a group of Native Americans who learn the use of smoke signals by observing the dust pillars formed by desert winds at the edges of mesas. The end of the story expresses Austin's discontent at how people have dealt with the weather by determining the best seasons to plant crops rather than by musing about the ""eternal meanings of the skies"". ;""The Little Town of the Grape Vines"" ""The Little Town of Grape Vines,"" or El Pueblo de Las Uvas, tells a story of a simple people living in peace with their environment. With houses made of mud, homemade wine, and gardens to provide the fruits, vegetables, and herbs, the townspeople live a simple life without the complex notions of wealth and class that Austin feels have corrupted much of society. Austin describes the lives of the people living in the town, lives which consist of little more than planting, harvesting, eating, making music, raising children, and dancing. The end of the story is a call back to the simple life exemplified in ""The Little Town of the Grape Vines,"" criticizing those people who are overly obsessed with their own perceived importance in a world where their actions truly matter little.
","Gutierrez continues to name the vast expanse of land in which he intends to enclose his estate. He names it after a particular Indian tribe, the Largano Indians, who are famous for their desert flora and fauna. Gosh darn it, there's not much else to say about this part of the U.S. besides ""the valley"" . The narrator describes the landscape as flat, barren, unkempt, and full of lost treasures. In other words, no one really knows where all the treasure is until they find it. And guess what? It turns out that some of the most important plants in the world--like cactils, elk , and jack rabbits--are actually buried in the sagebrush or have their roots buried deep in the ground. There's also a whole bunch of dried fruit on the ground but no food at all. So basically, everything is covered with dirt and weeds and dead animals. Oh yeah, and don't worry, we'll get rid of you soon enough. The Pocket Hunter travels to the West frequently. One day, he comes across Bill Gerry lying in a sandbar along the Grapevine. The Pocket Hunter finds and buries Bill. He never tells what happened to Bill during the flood but does say that it was caused by ""the invisible force"" of nature. In other words, whatever agency is working in the area, it will work its way into the earth eventually. Also, if you're wondering how old Bill is, he's got some really good stories to tell about him. For example, back in the early 1900s, Bill had gotten $10,000 from a Native American tribe for medicinal purposes. But since then, Bill has been living off the reservation all his life. And guess what? That money isn't even there anymore. It's gone straight to Mr. Wilkins' house. Which makes sense: Wilkins is now the local sheriff's pickpockets guy. What could possibly go wrong with that? Well, at least we don't think so. So anyway, let's head over to Wuthering Heights where Jimville can be found. The narrator describes the landscape and its inhabitants in great detail. He notes that both foxes and coyotes are very active killers for their love of killing. The red fox is a good talker but not as sharp as the big badger, who goes through the night at dawn to kill his own offspring. In contrast, the pauper-like Indian woman named Seyavie makes baskets out of dried herbs and spices. She also makes cooking pots from discarded quail shells. Native Americans call these ""Heather Bords"" because they remind them of springtime. They do not know how to count the days until midsummer, when rain begins. During this time, the valley has more than 3,000 native flora and fauna, including rare heirloom plants such as bamboo, elk, and prickly pearls. The narrator does not elaborate on the specific flora or fauna found in the mountains except to say that they are beautiful. In this chapter, the narrator explains how he came to know about plants and animals in general. For example, a native birch grows close to man's haunts but does not produce enough water to sustain its habitation. The narrator also describes as ""premeditation"" the medicinal use of herbs such as thyme, sycamore, ginger, and helenum , an orchid that has been domesticated by Europeans for thousands of years. In addition, there are many other flora and fossils which can be seen along the Sierra Madre River. These are some of the most important plants in the book. They are often overlooked because they are so low in elevation compared to the rest of the country. As far as the narrator is concerned, these are the only plants on the landscape that have any bearing on human behavior. He notes that if one were to go into a hilly area and look at a tall grassy hill country with no trees or shrubs growing alongside it, chances are you will find signs of civilization everywhere. advertisement",1.0757710451364215,0.21806853099829746
Tik-Tok of Oz," Queen Ann Soforth of Oogaboo, a small monarchy separated from the rest of Oz's Winkie Country, sets out to raise an army to conquer Oz. Seventeen men eventually make up the Army of Oogaboo; they march out of their valley. Glinda magically rearranges the path through the mountains and Queen Ann and her army march out of Oz into a low-lying, befogged country. Betsy Bobbin, a girl who is a year older than Dorothy Gale, and her loyal mule Hank are washed ashore during a storm. They arrive at a large greenhouse that is the domain of the Rose Kingdom, where the roses tell them that no strangers are allowed. Just as the Royal Gardener (apparently the only human allowed in this flowery kingdom) is about to pass sentence on Betsy and Hank, the Shaggy Man falls through the greenhouse's roof, and charms the Gardener into sparing all of their lives with his Love Magnet. The flowers, not having hearts, are unaffected by the Magnet, and force the travellers to leave, taking with them the newly plucked Rose Princess Ozga, a cousin of Ozma, the ruler of Oz. The Shaggy Man relates how Ozma sent him here by means of the Magic Belt because he wanted to find his brother, who went digging underground in Oklahoma and disappeared. He surmised that the Nome King, ruler of the underground Nome Kingdom, captured him. They meet up with Polychrome the Rainbow's Daughter; and they rescue Tik-Tok from the well where the Nome King had tossed him. Once Tik-Tok is wound up, he accompanies Betsy, Hank, the Shaggy Man, Ozga, and Polychrome to their chance encounter with Queen Ann and her army. In a rage, Queen Ann orders them to be seized and bound, but Private Files &mdash; the only private in this army of generals, colonels, and majors &mdash; refuses to bind innocent girls. He resigns his commission on the spot. When Queen Ann learns of the riches to be found in the Nome King's underground kingdom, she calms down and accepts the services of Tik-Tok as her new private. The Nome King (who has recovered from having drunk the Water of Oblivion in The Emerald City of Oz) is aghast at this group coming toward his underground kingdom. Since no one can be killed in Oz, the Nome King seeks to discourage them, first by taking them through the Rubber Country, and then disposing of them by dropping them through the Hollow Tube, a conduit leading to the other side of the world. There the party enters the jurisdiction of the immortal called Tittiti-Hoochoo, the Great Jinjin, who vows to punish the Nome King for using the Hollow Tube. He sends Tik-Tok and the others back with his Instrument of Vengeance, a lackadaisical dragon named Quox. Quox and his riders bound from the other end of the Tube into an army of Nomes and narrowly evade them. Queen Ann and the Army of Oogaboo fall into the Slimy Cave when they enter the Nome Kingdom; the Shaggy Man and his companions are captured by the Nome King. Ann and her army escape the cave while the Nome King amuses himself by transforming his captives into various objects. Quox arrives, bursting through the main cavern. The Nome King sees the ribbon around Quox's neck and forgets all the magic he ever knew. The Nome King is driven out of his kingdom when Quox releases six eggs from the padlock around his neck. The eggs, poisonous to Nomes, follow the Nome King to the Earth's surface and confine him there. The new Nome King, the former chief steward Kaliko, vows to help the Shaggy Man find his brother, who he knows is in the Metal Forest. The Shaggy Man meets his brother in the center of the Forest; but the brother was cursed with a charm of ugliness by the former Nome King. A kiss will break a charm. First Betsy, a mortal maid, tries to undo the spell; then Ozga, a mortal maid who was once a fairy, tries. Finally the fairy Polychrome's kiss restores the Shaggy Man's brother to his former self. There is a banquet of rejoicing in the Nome Kingdom, and the former Nome King earnestly pleads to be let back into the underground lair (""No Nome can really be happy except underground""), which Kaliko allows on condition that he behave himself. Once on the surface again, Polychrome ascends her rainbow and Ozma uses the magic belt to bring Tik-Tok back to Oz and send Queen Ann, the Army of Oogaboo, Files, and Ozga back to Oogaboo. The Shaggy Man only agrees to return when his brother, Betsy, and Hank are allowed to enter Oz too. Upon being welcomed in Oz, Hank, the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, and the Saw-Horse debate who is the best mistress &mdash; Betsy (for Hank), Dorothy (for the Lion and the Tiger), or Ozma (for the Saw-Horse). The three girls are listening and laugh at a silly quarrel, which the animals realize is silly too. In addition, Dorothy finally gets to hear her dog Toto speak &mdash; for all animals can in the Land of Oz.
","This chapter introduces the first book in the animated series, Tik- Tok of Oz . The story is set in the fictional Ozma kingdom. It has a number of characters and settings that are not included in other Oz stories. For example, there's an interesting play called The Tik-Tik Man of America , but it doesn't really do anything besides tell about the people who live in the land around them. There are also lots of weird happenings going on in this imaginary world. First up is the discovery of a huge, bloodthirsty, disease-stricken creature named ""The Metal Monarch,"" or simply ""the Love Magnet"" . Then we get to find out more about the Rolodexes and how they got there. And now for Chapter Five: Inside the Fairyland Of Oz. In Chapter Five, the narrator gives us a brief account of the events leading up to the creation of this novel. Basically, everything seems to be going according to plan. You can read all the details here if you're looking for a good ol' fashioned romp down memory lane. Oh yeah, and don't worry--we'll take care of you when you're done with your romp."" Also, FYI: If you haven't already been warned, head over to our site right now to check it out. The Rain King accidentally drops some water on a well, which causes it to rain. This forces the Rain King to spill his entire basin of water onto the ground and then re-arrests Polychrome who tries to help her. She is caught again but this time in a desolate country with no human inhabitants. The travelers decide to continue on until they find their way to ""the Metal Monarch,"" where they hope to find their lost brother. They begin their journey when they come across a well that serves as a sort of crossroads between the mountains and the ocean. It also serves as an important crossing point for the Underground War because it gives them access to the mineral baths from the outside world. After exploring the well for a while, they come upon Bulbasa's Nome Kingdom, complete with its jeweled mule , cymbals, trees, and much more. Bulbasara has been banished from Ozga's kingdom by Uogaboos tyrannical father, Emperor Tullusai.Bulbasa says he will not tolerate any more trouble if he can just get rid of all these nomes. He does however, plan to use Bulbasas' power to conquer the rest of the World. In Chapter Nine, Bulbasala tells us that there are three things going on: 1) An army of soldiers marching towards him; 2) A giant rock containing thousands of precious stones; 3) Gunpowder ; and 4) The Love Magnet . Bulbasato points out that each soldier must have at least one weapon--that is, a hammer, a sander, or whatever else might be needed to break through the thicket of the underground world. Oh, yeah, and 5) The drums sound off in the distance. Bullets go off, and Bulbasatapa runs away. Uh-oh. Titushe-wechoo explains to the group that they must go to the ""Private Citizen,"" a government official who will take care of them once they get there. They do, and shortly thereafter hear a loud bell signaling that it is time for them to enter the ""Tube"" . Uh-oh. The Underground Kingdom has been transformed into an all or nothing place with lots of shiny new things in it. It's called the 'Tube' because it allows people to pass through without being forced inside. There are six nomes--Betsy, Tetra-Choo, Scaggy , Sunlight , Electra , Starlight , Firelight , and Poyote. Betsy wants to eat her own food, but Polychrome insists on eating hers herself. Finally, Titito-Hooschoo tells the group about his plan to rid the world of its ugly, evil, dragon-like urchins. He also says that he'll use Quox to bring back some of their lost friends. Tik-Tok manages to evade the guards and escapes into the ""Slimy Cave,"" where he meets Bulbasaur, who is chained up in a secret passage. He tries to escape by throwing rocks at his enemies, but they refuse to let him go. The group finally finds their way inside the cavernous fortress. Inside, they find Bulbasur waiting for them. They are attacked by Gungeo's men, who shoot at them with their bows and arrows. After Gungeho shoots one of Gungego's men , Gungehosein rounds up some officers and throws them into the deep cave. Bullets strike Gungehae as he runs away.Bulbasaur makes it back to NomeKing Kaliko before he has time to tell everyone that he is going to be the new king. In order to get there quickly, though--he says goodbye to Betsy and then heads off to have a little fun. Bulletin: The Metal Forest In this chapter, Bulletin reveals that he and his fellow nomes have escaped through a tunnel filled with sharp rocks. They are reunited with their former King, who they now call the ""New King."" He has been exiled from his kingdom in favor of Kooliko, the new king of the Ozglades. Kaliko explains to them that the new kingship is not for everyone, but rather for the common nomes themselves. After learning more about the history of the metal-forest, it becomes clear that Bulletins brother was once an ugly, unladylike creature before being transformed into beautiful, well-to-do Betsy. Also, Bulletta's mother had died long ago, so she can no longer claim ownership of her son. Lastly, we get another brief look at Ugly Man--he turns out to be really ugly, just like Betsy. Uh-oh. Oh, yeah, and Betsy wants to see him. She also wants to know if anyone else has seen Betsy or Hank on the path to the Crystal Palace. It turns out that Betsy actually lives there as well. And Betsy does indeed want to go meet Betsy. advertisement",2.252005831965706,0.24242423749770445
Further Adventures of Lad," ;""The Coming of Lad"" A couple, referred to only as the Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window with a bag of loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog. ;""The Fetish"" While in town with the Mistress, Lad saves her from an attack by a sick dog being chased by the police and other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, ordering the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him. ;""No Trespassing!"" Two young couples trespass on the Place's lake shore, only to be driven off by the Master and Lad. A week later, Lad is taken to compete in a dog show in Beauville. One of the men from the lake is there to show his boss' champion Lochaber King. He plots to dye Lad's coat red to embarrass the Master for the earlier incident, but accidentally dyes Lochaber King's coat instead, after the two dogs change locations. He is left having to answer for the dog's ruined coat while Lad wins the silver trophy. ;""Hero-Stuff"" The Master and Mistress buy a female collie puppy named Lady to be Lad's companion and mate. Lad becomes her protector and slave, as she bullies him from his food and the best places to lie, and endures the flashes of nasty temper that lead her to bite his ears and paws. As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in a shed for the night as punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats. ;""The Stowaway"" When Lady returns from a fifteen-week hospital stay, she abandons Lad to play with their son Wolf, whom she no longer recognizes. The moping Lad takes to hiding in the car to beg for a ride, and accidentally becomes a stowaway when the Master and Mistress go to the Catskills to visit friends. As dogs are not allowed in the residential park where they are staying, they take Lad to a kennel, but he quickly escapes and returns to the park. While waiting for the Master and Mistress to wake up, he follows a strange scent through a neighbor's house, leading to his being blamed for destroying a room in that house. However, it's quickly discovered that the vandal was another neighbor's pet monkey, hidden by its owner who did not like the park's new ""no pet"" rules. When Lad returns home, Lady effusively greets her returned mate. ;""The Tracker"" Cyril, an eleven-year-old with a nasty penchant for making trouble, comes to stay at the Place for three months. While there, he frequently lies, sneakily torments Lad, and plays such horrible pranks on the staff that two quit. After he is caught kicking Lad in plain sight, the Master loses his temper and scolds him. Cyril goes into a rage and runs away in a snowstorm. He gets lost and falls off a high cliff, landing on a small ledge. Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives. ;""The Juggernaut"" Lad's mate Lady is run over and killed by a speeding driver who deliberately aimed his car at her. Lad and his owners both saw the crime, but were unable to catch up to the driver in time. Lad grieves terribly until they go to a local tennis tournament where he finds Lady's killer. He attacks the man to kill him, but the Master calls him off. The Mistress explains to the shocked crowd what the man had done, then takes a cured Lad home. They later learn that the crowd destroyed the man's expensive car and he was expelled from the club for killing Lady. ;""In Strange Company"" The Master and Mistress take Lad on their annual fall camping trip to the mountains for two weeks. During the trip, Lad playfully teases a bear, leading to a fight, which the master ends by scaring off the bear. At the end of the trip, Lad is accidentally left tied to a tree at the camp site. While his owners are returning to find their missing dog, Lad is trapped by a forest fire. When the bear he fought earlier rushes past with singed fur, Lad chews through his rope and follows the other animals of the forest to sit in a nearby lake. When his owners arrive, he runs through the burning fire to join them, blistering his paws on some coals. ;""Old Dog; New Tricks"" After 12-year-old Lad is praised for bringing the Mistress a lace parasol that he found on the road, he begins searching the road for more things to find, sometimes stealing them unintentionally from people who were nearby but not watching their items. As he had gotten more sensitive in his older age, his owners always praised him for the gifts, which ranged from a full picnic basket to roadkill. One night, he ""finds"" a baby, who was kidnapped from a wealthy household by a disgruntled former employee and his kin. The baby had been set in the grass by his two kidnappers while they changed a flat tire. The kidnappers eventually catch up to Lad, who is carrying the child home. He fights off the men when they attack him, eventually chasing them back to their car, and they escape. The baby is returned to his parents and the kidnappers arrested, but Lad is hurt that his present results in no praise, just a lot of activity around the house. ;""The Intruders"" A large, cranky sow escapes from its herd and attacks the Mistress after she tries to shoo it out of her garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his old age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily drive her off. While fleeing, the pig runs directly into the path of one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from joining them at the end, but he quickly forgives her. ;""The Guard"" At 16, the aging Lad befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father works at the Place. Her father forces her to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats her if she is slow. The Master and the Place's superintendent try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage to stand up to her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.
","The narrator tells the story of a dog named Lad, who is orphaned by his owners. The owner of the place decides that he needs a new dog--Laddie--so he sends him to live in a ""crampy"" crate with an intricate pedigree. When it's time to go back to work, however, Lad shows no signs of abominable behavior during his first five months at the shelter. He does manage to catch a thief one time, but when he tries to chase after the thief, he gets shot in the leg and has to be restrained from pursuing the thief. Meanwhile, Lad continues to grow more and more attached to the house as the days pass. One morning, Lad sees a man approach the Place while on a morning walk. It turns out the man is a police constable. We're not sure what this means, but suffice it to say, Lad doesn't like being around law-abiding people any longer. Wefers comes to Lad's rescue with a pistol in his hand. He tells Lad that he has shot three dogs, including one that was rabid and one that had no rabies or was not at all likely rabid. They throw the gun at him and he flies after it. Mistress is horrified but does not see this as an act of cruelty. She accuses Lad of trespassing on her property without any court orders or other authority. Lad tries to defend himself by throwing the gun back into the air. The master grabs the pistol and tosses it away. Lads reaction is ""caught up in the law"" . It turns out that Lad doesn't have a legal right to do what he wants--to shoot someone else. But hey, we'll take care of our own affairs. Meanwhile, Lad gets pulled into a raging torrent of mud when he sees a large collie swimming towards them. Soon enough, however, Lad realizes that there are two people who will be paying attention to their trespass: Master and Mistress. In Chapter V, the narrator explains that Lad is getting ready to be adopted by a new family of collies. He wants to know how he can hold and dye his dog so that it doesn't bite him while he's out in the wild. In order to do this, however, he hires Colonel Osborn who owns the local collie breeders. They set up an adoring home for their pup, named Lad. One day, Lady accidentally runs into a runaway collie puppy during one of her many walks around the property. The master immediately realizes that Lady has been neglecting her duties as a house-broken lab/dog at the present time. When Lad returns home from the rescue, he finds Lady suffering from ""distemper,"" a psychological disorder caused by exposure to chemicals used in medicine. She also suffers from bronchiolitis, a nerve-wracking disease that affects both puppies and humans. Lad tries to help Lady but fails miserably. Meanwhile, Lady attempts to escape through the back door of Master's toolhouse. However, she manages to sneak past two escaped dogs: Lady and Little Wolf. Lad spends the next six hours at the Harmon home, where his master and Mistress plan to have lunch. While on the way, a young black dog named Lad runs up to them and tries to steal some luggage out of their unlocked car. The master realizes that he has no choice but to bring Lad along with him. When they arrive back at the house, there is a strange sight: a large gray monkey roams the grounds outside the residence. It attacks Lad, knocks him down, and then lures him back inside. He returns to the apartment in time for Master and Mistress to make an announcement about their coming home. Lad comes upon a fence line that separates the upper section of the property from the neighboring neighbor's. He triples over it and lands on top of a tall, narrow ledge. The only way out is for Cyril to lead him back to his rightful place in the world. Lad does not want anyone to find him; he decides to go home and try to figure out how to get there himself. He starts off by barking at the bobcat, which has come to chase after him. When Lad gets closer to the cage where Lady is being held, the bobsledder-like dog catches a stick and smashes it against the cage wall. This happens about once every four years or so. Lad spends most of his time near Lady, who loves him very much. However, one day when Lad sees a speeding motor car approaching, he nearly runs over its driver but manages to avoid hitting the man driving the vehicle. Luckily, Lad saves the life of an innocent bystander. Lad spends two weeks in the wilderness with his master and guide, Barret and their dog. One day, Lad encounters a bear cub that has been feeding on honeycotted bees. He leaps over the bear cubs head to chase it away. Afterward, Lad runs into the forest again, only to encounter another bear cub. This time, however, he is able to catch the bear before it can get to him. Finally, after much coaxing, Lad returns to camp, where he finds a lacey parasol tied to a tree trunk. The scent of the burned-out parasol convinces Lad that there must be a way to retrieve the missing items from the boxcar. In the meantime, Lad begins to notice signs of life at the place--the smell of woodsmoke, the taste of firewood, and even the appearance of an injured bulldog. The next morning, Lad goes out to search for the missing lunch. He sees a car pull up beside a grassy patch of turf where several people are having a picnic. The owner of the basket drops it down and Lad grabs it as he walks by. It has been left in the dirt behind the car while the rest of the group is setting up their picnic table. When Lad reaches the spot, he realizes that the basket belongs to someone else. This person must have been one of those hired thugs who stole the basket when they were planning on robbing the family. Thus far, no one has figured out how to solve this mystery. Then there's the kidnapping of Romaine Shmoopens baby. She convinces her brother-in-law to kidnap the baby so she can take care of it herself. Later, Lad tries to rescue the baby from his captors' grasp with a gun. Unfortunately, however, he runs into a gang of thieves who try to steal the baby through an unlocked garage door. Luckily, Lad manages to escape without being caught. advertisement",3.8441011801122325,0.28051947559828344

In London the killer dubbed Mr. Smith by the press is conducting a live autopsy. Mr. Smith explains to his victim what he will be feeling and that he envies his victim. At union station, Soneji opens fire on the crowd with a rifle. Cross and Sampson receive a call from Soneji letting him know where he is. Cross was expecting Kyle Craig, who had faxed Cross a letter asking for help with the Mr. Smith case. When Sampson and Cross get there, four people have already been killed. Cross and Sampson find the rifle and discover that it had been set up on a timer to randomly shoot downward. Soneji was actually on a train headed to New York City. Soneji is at Penn Station in New York City. There, he stabs a man in the back with a big hunting knife he used to kill Roger Graham in Along Came a Spider. Soneji then escapes in a subway. Cross is driving by the school and stops when he sees his girlfriend Christine’s car. When she gets home, they go for a walk, and Christine confesses that she worries about him getting hurt or killed in the line of duty.

Goldman is sure that Soneji behind it. Once in New York City, Cross meets with Goldman at Penn Station. A total of three people have been stabbed with a knife laced with poison. The next day Cross takes his cat, Rosie, to Quantico to be examined by the FBI. Cross is afraid that Soneji did something to the cat before giving her to him. He also meets with Kyle, who wants Cross involved in the Mr. Smith case but Alex refuses. Cross agrees to see Agent Thomas Pierce, whose own girlfriend was one of Mr. Smith's victims. Afterwards, Alex checks on Rosie, who had nothing wrong with her. In London, Mr. Smith calls the police a few blocks down telling them where to find Inspector Drew Cabot's body. Thomas Pierce is in London. He works on the Mr. Smith case almost exclusively. He’s trying to figure out the message Mr. Smith is trying to send. Sampson and Cross are in Wilmington, Delaware. They are going to visit Soneji’s wife and daughter. Cross smells decay and sees flies. They find the decapitated body of a Labrador Retriever. They discover that Soneji had decapitated his wife, but spared their daughter. Later, Cross goes to Lorton prison, where Soneji had been kept during Along Came a Spider. Cross was there to meet with a prisoner named Jamal Autry who told Cross that Soneji was raped in prison and contracted AIDS. Cross now understands that Soneji is planning one final rampage before he dies. In New York City, Soneji quietly breaks into Manning Goldman’s house at night, and hits him over the head with a lead pipe. Kyle Craig lends Alex use of the FBI helicopter to make his way to NYC. Cross meets with Goldman’s partner. They make their way to Goldman’s home in Riverdale. In the bedroom there is blood everywhere. The blood was splattered on the bed, the walls, and the floor. This was a brutal attack. Elsewhere in a bar, Soneji pick up a woman and goes with her to her apartment. Alex and the NYPD think Soneji is going after the man that raped him in prison, Shareef Thomas. They find Shareef in Brooklyn inside a crack house. A struggle ensues as they try to arrest Thomas, and Cross shoots and kills him. In Paris, Mr. Smith attacks and kills a young doctor who had just left his girlfriends house. At Bellevue Hospital, Soneji goes to find Thomas, who he believes is in intensive care. Soneji is dressed as a male nurse and wearing another disguise. Soneji goes into the room, only to find Cross and Detective Groza, Goldman’s partner, waiting for him in the room. Soneji is impressed, but prepared, as he throws a small Incendiary bomb at the detectives. Cross and Groza pull the bed on them to shelter themselves from the brunt of the bomb. Soneji makes his way out of the hospital and escapes in a city bus. Cross is afraid that Soneji plans on blowing up the bus. Cross thinks Soneji is trying to reach Grand Central Station, which proves to be correct, when Soneji makes his way out of the bus and runs toward it carrying a baby in his arm. Groza and Cross follow Soneji. They corner Soneji who swears that Cross will pay for everything. Soneji gets away by throwing the baby. The baby is caught but while everyone looks at the baby on the air Soneji makes a run for the tunnels. Groza and Cross pursue Soneji again. Soneji attacks Groza from behind. Alex and Soneji fight. Soneji swears that he'll go after Cross, even if he dies. Cross shoots Soneji in the jaw. The madman falls to the ground, accidentally detonating the other bomb in his pocket, burning him. A few days later, Cross returns home. He spends the entire day with his family. Kyle Craig calls Cross and again asks for help on the Mr. Smith case. Cross says no. Alex's family throws him a party. That night, an unknown assailant attacks Cross and his family, beating them and shooting him; Cross believes that it was Soneji. Agent Thomas Pierce examines the scene and wonders why the kids were left to live. He deduces they were beaten to make a statement but killing them was not the plan. Pierce concludes that Soneji is innocent of the attacks. Pierce examines the room and notices all the blood in the room. Soon he is told Cross has gone into cardiac arrest due to loss of blood. Kyle and Thomas head to St. Anthony’s Hospital. Thomas reminisces about his days in medical school and his girlfriend, Isabella, who was murdered by Mr. Smith. Traumatized, Pierce had given up medicine. Back in Paris, Inspector Rene Faulk investigates the young surgeon's disappearance. After looking and analyzing evidence at Cross's home, Pierce is sure that Soneji was not Cross' attacker. Pierce finds Cross' shield, burned and charred. Sampson and Pierce head to Princeton, New Jersey to examine the area where Soneji was raised. They went to talk with Soneji’s grandfather, Walter Murphy. They dig in the back and find human and animal bones, which had apparently been Soneji's first victims. At the hotel, Pierce gets an e mail from Mr. Smith that he took a young surgeon in Pierce’s honor. Mr. Smith has been contacting Pierce before he commits a murder and challenges Pierce to stop him. Pierce needs to go. Sampson is not happy with it. Mr. Smith named himself after Valentine Michael Smith from the book Stranger in a Strange Land. Mr. Smith does another live autopsy on Abel Sante. On the way to Paris, Pierce reviews notes and tries to determine what kind of a person Mr. Smith really is. Upon reaching Paris and checking into a hotel, Pierce reads his e mail from Mr. Smith and tells him where to find the doctor’s body. Pierce is accompanied by an Interpol agent named Sandy Greenberg. In the email, Mr. Smith tells Pierce not to trust her. Pierce recovers Dr. Sante’s body. His head had been separated from the body and the head had been cut in half. Pierce is at the Cross house. He’s examining Cross' room and is convinced that Soneji had a partner. Pierce takes Sampson with him to Princeton and to meet a childhood friend of Soneji’s, Simon Conklin. Pierce thinks he’s the one that tried to kill Cross, but Conklin has an alibi. After interviewing Conklin, Pierce is not only convinced Conklin did it, but that Soneji had been taking orders from him. Pierce breaks in to Conklin’s house. Pierce can’t find evidence that Conklin tried to kill Alex but after viewing the house is now sure Conklin is the killer. The book resumes going to Alex’s point of view. He is addressing a group of FBI agents at Quantico. It is revealed that the attack had been a hoax, orchestrated by Craig in order to manipulate Pierce, who is none other than Mr. Smith. Pierce had actually killed his girlfriend when he caught her cheating on him with another doctor. The resulting trauma created in Pierce a split personality, with the ""Mr. Smith"" becoming more and more dominant. The authorities only have circumstantial evidence. The FBI is hoping that being involved in this case will let Pierce go after Conklin and let the FBI catch him in the act. Sara Greenberg tells the agent that Pierce was spotted at all the recent murders. Agents are outside Conklin’s house. Inside, Pierce begins a live autopsy on Conklin, but first is trying to get a confession from Conklin for attacking Dr. Cross. The agents go in, but it’s too late. Conklin is dead and Mr. Smith has escaped. Before dying, Conklin had confessed to trying to kill Cross. Cross offers to go to Boston, Massachusetts to look at Pierce’s apartment. The apartment is full of pictures of Pierce’s dead girlfriend. Cross receives a voicemail from Pierce telling Cross where to find Smith’s next victim. The victim is found but all the organs were removed. Mr. Smith later kills a prostitute. Cross returns home and tries to find a connection. He writes the name of the victim in order and finds the connection. It was in the names. It spelled i-m-u-r-d-e-r-e-d-i-s-a-b-e-l-l-a-c-a-l-a-i-s. (I murdered Isabella Calais). The s in Calais had not been completed. Alex knew the last victim would be Dr. Straw, the man Isabella was having the affair with. The FBI set up another stakeout. Pierce shows up but keeps going in his car. Cross goes after Pierce and go on a high speed chase. The cars eventually go on a side road. Pierce loses Cross for a few minutes. When Cross and Sampson find Pierce’s car, Pierce is gone. Alex knows he wants to complete the puzzle. The S for Smith. Cross returns to Boston. At the apartment Smith had done a self autopsy. Alex tries to stop Pierce from killing himself and the two end up fighting. Sampson shoots Pierce, pointblank. it:Gatto & topo
","The novel opens with a brief introduction of Ralph Williams' Cat and Mause. The book begins with a description of Ed Brown's trapping expedition to the otherworld, where he discovers a large bison-like creature, called the ""Harn,"" living off the land. He kills several animals, including a small quadruped, but does not find any human beings in the second world. After Ed finishes his trapping, he heads back into the wilderness to begin another round of trapping. By nightfall, Ed has set up camp on a hill overlooking the Ford while Tom is busy harvesting marten from the nearby spring grizzlies. Ed finds a hole in the side of a tree that will allow him to get into the Otherworld without having to shoot or kill anything. In this hole, Ed shoots at least three times, killing all but one. Soon afterward, he hears a rattlesnake bugle call, which reminds him that it is time for him to go hunting. As dawn breaks, Ed sets out again, hoping to catch the rattler. But when he gets there, nothing seems to be going wrong. advertisement",0.00098629,0.15940223869883954
Equality," The story takes up immediately after the events of Looking Backward with the main characters from the first novel, Julian West, Doctor Leete, and his daughter Edith. West tells his nightmare of return to the 19th century to Edith, who is sympathetic. West's citizenship in the new America is recognized, and he goes to the bank to obtain his own account, or ""credit card"", from which he can draw on the annual stipend all citizens receive. He learns that Edith and her mother do not normally wear the long skirts he has seen them in (they have been wearing them so his 19th century sensibilities will not be shocked), and when Edith learns that he would not be shocked to see them dressed otherwise, immediately runs into the house and comes out dressed as a modern woman in a pants suit. Clothing varies widely, since it is made of strengthened paper, and is recycled when dirty and replaced at very small expense (shoes and dishes are made of variations on the same substance). Julian learns that women are free to compete in many of the same trades as men; the manager of the paper factory he goes to view is a woman. Edith herself is in the second year of the three year general labor period required of everyone before choosing a trade, but is on leave from that employment. The two tour a tenement house, in which no one now lives, kept as a reminder of things how used to be and a reminder not to go back to them. Julian opens his safe (a device unknown in 2000 outside museums). Dr. Leete sees his mortgages and securities not as long-obsolete claims to ownership interest in things, but rather in people and their labor. The papers are worthless except as antiquities, as most of such papers were burned at the conclusion of the economic transition, in a great blaze on the former site of the New York Stock Exchange. The gold coins in the safe are admired for their prettiness, but are also worthless. Julian learns more about the world of the year 2000. Handwriting has been virtually replaced by phonograph records, and jewelry is no longer used, since jewels are now worthless. Julian is amazed by a television-like device, called the electroscope. World communication is simplified, since everyone now speaks a universal language in addition to his native tongue. Not only are there motor cars, but also private air cars. Everyone is now vegetarian, and the thought of eating meat is looked upon with revulsion. The book concludes with an almost uninterrupted series of lectures from Dr. Leete and other characters, mostly concerning how the idyllic state West has arrived in was achieved.
","Charles Dudley Warner presents a new edition of his book, entitled Equality. The book begins with the premise that all humans are created ""altered."" This is not to be confused with the concept of equality; it's just that there are inequalities inherent in human nature. In fact, according to Darwinist scholar John Morell, economic theory and social theory developed during the eighteenth-century under the leadership of Henry Louisa May Alcott. Sociologists have argued for more than a century that this age should attempt to rediscover the concepts of equality--equality of opportunity, civil society, freedom of choice, and political freedom. They argue that these ideas must be redrafted so that they no longer conflict with the scientific theories of earlier generations. advertisement",0.18388440561699565,0.13774104291570863
A Passage to India," A young British schoolmistress, Adela Quested, and her elderly friend, Mrs. Moore, visit the fictional city of Chandrapore, British India. Adela is to marry Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny Heaslop, the city magistrate. Meanwhile, Dr. Aziz, a young Indian Muslim physician, is dining with two of his Indian friends and conversing about whether it is possible to be friends with an Englishman. During the meal, a summons arrives from Major Callendar, Aziz's unpleasant superior at the hospital. Aziz hastens to Callendar's bungalow as ordered, but is delayed by a flat tyre and difficulty in finding a tonga and the major has already left in a huff. Disconsolate, Aziz walks down the road toward the railway station. When he sees his favourite mosque, a rather ramshackle but beautiful structure, he enters on impulse. He sees a strange Englishwoman there, and angrily yells at her not to profane this sacred place. The woman, who turns out to be Mrs Moore, has respect for native customs (she had taken off her shoes before entering and she acknowledged that ""God is here"" in the mosque) disarms Aziz, and the two chat and part as friends. Mrs. Moore returns to the British club down the road and relates her experience at the mosque. Ronny Heaslop, her son, initially thinks she is talking about an Englishman, and becomes indignant when he learns the facts. He thinks she should have indicated by her tone that it was a ""Mohammedan"" who was in question. Adela, however, is intrigued. Because the newcomers had expressed a desire to see Indians, Mr. Turton, the city tax collector, invites numerous Indian gentlemen to a party at his house. The party turns out to be an awkward business, thanks to the Indians' timidity and the Britons' bigotry, but Adela does meet Cyril Fielding, headmaster of Chandrapore's government-run college for Indians. Fielding invites Adela and Mrs. Moore to a tea party with him and a Hindu-Brahmin professor named Narayan Godbole. On Adela's request, he extends his invitation to Dr. Aziz. At Fielding's tea party, everyone has a good time conversing about India, and Fielding and Aziz even become great friends. Aziz buoyantly promises to take Mrs. Moore and Adela to see the Marabar Caves, a distant cave complex that everyone talks about but no one seems to actually visit. Aziz's Marabar invitation was one of those casual promises that people often make and never intend to keep. Ronny Heaslop arrives and rudely breaks up the party. Aziz mistakenly believes that the women are really offended that he has not followed through on his promise and arranges the outing at great expense to himself. Fielding and Godbole were supposed to accompany the little expedition, but they miss the train. Aziz and the women begin to explore the caves. In the first cave, however, Mrs. Moore is overcome with claustrophobia, for the cave is dark and Aziz's retinue has followed her in. The press of people nearly smothers her. But worse than the claustrophobia is the echo. No matter what sound one makes, the echo is always ""Boum."" Disturbed by the echo, Mrs. Moore declines to continue exploring. So Adela and Aziz, accompanied by a single guide, a local man, climb on up the hill to the next cluster of caves. As Aziz helps Adela up the hill, she innocently asks him whether he has more than one wife. Disconcerted by the bluntness of the remark, he ducks into a cave to compose himself. When he comes out, he finds the guide sitting alone outside the caves. The guide says Adela has gone into one of the caves by herself. Aziz looks for her in vain. Deciding she is lost, he angrily punches the guide, who runs away. Aziz looks around again and discovers Adela's field-glasses (similar to binoculars) lying broken on the ground. He puts them in his pocket. Then Aziz looks down the hill and sees Adela speaking to another young Englishwoman, Miss Derek, who has arrived with Fielding in a car. Aziz runs down the hill and greets Fielding effusively, but Miss Derek and Adela have already driven off without a word of explanation. Fielding, Mrs. Moore, and Aziz return to Chandrapore on the train. Then the blow falls. At the train station, Dr. Aziz is arrested and charged with sexually assaulting Adela in a cave. She reports the alleged incident to the British authorities. The run-up to Aziz's trial for attempted sexual assault releases the racial tensions between the British and the Indians. Adela accuses Aziz only of trying to touch her. She says that he followed her into the cave and tried to grab her, and that she fended him off by swinging her field glasses at him. She remembers him grabbing the glasses and the strap breaking, which allowed her to get away. The only actual evidence the British have is the field glasses in the possession of Dr. Aziz. Despite this, the British colonists firmly believe that Aziz is guilty; at the back of all their minds is the conviction that all darker peoples lust after white women. They are stunned when Fielding proclaims his belief in Aziz's innocence. Fielding is ostracized and condemned as a blood-traitor. But the Indians, who consider the assault allegation a fraud aimed at ruining their community's reputation, welcome him. During the weeks before the trial, Mrs. Moore is unexpectedly apathetic and irritable. Her experience in the cave seems to have ruined her faith in humanity. Although she curtly professes her belief in Aziz's innocence, she does nothing to help him. Ronny, alarmed by his mother's assertion that Aziz is innocent, decides to arrange for her return by ship to England before she can testify to this effect at the trial. Mrs. Moore dies during the voyage. Her absence from India becomes a major issue at the trial, where Aziz's legal defenders assert that her testimony alone, had it been available, would have proven the accused's innocence. After an initial period of fever and weeping, Adela becomes confused as to Aziz's guilt. At the trial, she is asked point-blank whether Aziz sexually assaulted her. She asks for a moment to think before replying. She has a vision of the cave in that moment, and it turns out that Adela had, while in the cave, received a shock similar to Mrs. Moore's. The echo had disconcerted her so much that she temporarily became unhinged. She ran around the cave, fled down the hill, and finally sped off with Miss Derek. At the time, Adela mistakenly interpreted her shock as an assault by Aziz, who personifies the India that has stripped her of her psychological innocence, but he was never there. She admits that she was mistaken. The case is dismissed. (Note that in the 1913 draft of the novel EM Forster originally had Aziz guilty of the assault and found guilty in the court, but later changed this in the 1924 draft to create a more ambiguous ending). All the English are shocked and infuriated by what they view as Adela's betrayal of the white race. Ronny Heaslop breaks off their engagement. Adela stays at Fielding's house until her passage on a boat to England is arranged. After explaining to Fielding that the echo was the cause of the whole business, she departs India, never to return. Although he is free and vindicated, Aziz is angry and bitter that his friend, Fielding, would befriend Adela after she nearly ruined his life. Believing it to be the gentlemanly thing to do, Fielding convinces Aziz not to seek monetary redress from her. The two men's friendship suffers in consequence, and Fielding soon departs for England. Aziz believes that he is leaving to marry Adela for her money. Bitter at his friend's perceived betrayal, he vows never again to befriend a white person. Aziz moves to the Hindu-ruled state of Mau and begins a new life. Two years later, Fielding returns to India and to Aziz. His wife is Stella, Mrs. Moore's daughter from a second marriage. Aziz, now the Raja's chief physician, at first persists in his anger against his old friend. But in time, he comes to respect and love Fielding again. However, he does not give up his dream of a free and united India. In the novel's last sentences, he explains that he and Fielding cannot be friends, at least not until India is free of the British Raj. Even the earth and the sky seem to say, ""Not yet.""
","Chandrapore is described in this chapter as having gardens and a forest. The inhabitants of the forest, which are covered with mud, rise out of their stifling temples. They do not seem to be sad, but rather intrigued by the fact that they are surrounded by trees and flowers. At one point, however , Aziz loses his bicycle and falls on the veranda. He apologizes profusely for his late arrival and asks to see his wife. She tells him that she has had a conversation with a doctor who asked her to look after his wounded leg. Afterward, he goes off to visit his family at the Sarajevo Mosque. While there, he encounters an old Indian woman whom he does not recognize; she tries to get him to tell her about the incident at the Masjid. Later, when he returns home, he learns that the local authorities have decided to issue an invitation to several Indian women from the Turton household so that they may meet with them during the week. The Bridge Party is a disappointment. The narrator notes that the Indians do not show up for the bridge party, despite the fact that many of them have come from India. They speak of Cousin Kate, which has been praised by the local newspaper, but an unsophisticated edition of the paper reports that Miss Darcys and Mrs. Barlow are unable to attend due to their lack of English language proficiency. Meanwhile, Fielding tries to appeal to his Indian compatriots about how they should behave with respect in India. He tells them that he will be coming to tea on Thursday. When Fielding returns home, he discovers that he has forgotten to bring his wife's portrait to tea; this makes him even more unhappy. Fielding introduces himself to a group of Indian ladies who are coming for tea. They all agree that they will be having a good time, but when Aziz mentions India, Fielding is offended because he has never been to India before. He then tells them about his practice in India and how he hopes to one day become a doctor there. After the women leave, Rodolpho asks if they would like to go see him in the ""Marabar caves"" with some Englishmen. When Adela says she doesn't want to visit India at all though, he responds by saying that she can come too. The next morning, after much arguing over which direction to travel, they run into an Indian man whom they have not yet spoken to. This upsets Ronny so much that he falls asleep. Later, on their way home from the meeting, MissQuested suggests to her mother that they call it quits. She wants to get out of this situation as quickly as possible. The next day, Fielding asks about the happenings at the roadside inn. The narrator tells us that he and his grandson are playing a game called ""Patience"" in which they try to convince each other of the supernatural powers of heaven and earth. Unfortunately, this game is not going very well. After some time has passed, the group decides to go back to their hotel for another round of matrimonial meetings. This time, however, there is no one there to listen to them; instead, they rely on fielding as their mediator. They decide to set up a mock-Tea Party with Aziz's family so that she will be able to keep track of her husband while he is away. As soon as they leave the teacup, people start talking about Cholera and its effects on the health of the Indian population. It becomes clear that these conversations have been misinterpreted by the English authorities as an attempt to improve relations between India and the West. The next morning, the travelers board the train for Sharm el-Sheikh, who is to serve as Major-Domo. After a few days of travel, they arrive in Sharm El-Weikh, accompanied by his friends and their hired Indian servant, Mohammed al-Farooq. They all agree that this trip will be interesting, although Adela finds it hard to get along with her fellow travelers because she has been traveling without them for two months. She also realizes that she does not have enough time to devote to any one person during the entire journey; instead, she must devote herself entirely to making others happy. Meanwhile, on the train ride back to India, Arabella discovers that she has run away from her hyena's burial place. The only thing she can do is talk to her family about her feelings for them. Fielding discovers that Aziz has been invited to the picnic by Fielding's mistress, Miss Derek; he had planned to take her back to his Indian friends. The excursion is over when Fielding finds out that she has gone missing. He apologizes for being late, and explains that there was no such thing as an impromptu picnic because Aziz did not want to make it up to MissQuested. After Fielding leaves, Major Munro arrives with the news of Aziz' arrest. He asks Fielding to help him find a way to free Aziz without having to force him into any trouble. As Fielding departs, Turton informs him that they are going to have to issue bail for Aziz in order to clear his name. When fielding tries to intervene, Munro tells Fielding that if Aziz does not get bail then he will be arrested himself. This makes Fielding even more determined to go after Aziz personally. Fielding tries to defend himself, but is attacked by the Collector. He tells them that Aziz has paid a prostitute to suffice his mother before she could get out. The collector then accuses him of bribing and threatens to release him if he does not do so. After this incident, they move on to their new allies in the district. They all feel sorry for Adela because she seems to have no real interest in anything other than her own past. She begins to cry more frequently when she thinks about the fact that she will soon be dead. Meanwhile, Major Oakeshott makes an attempt to convince her that perhaps she should leave India as quickly as possible since she cannot stand up for herself anymore. The trial begins. The superintendent of police, the district attorney, and several other officials testify against Aziz in front of a packed courtroom. He makes no moral appeal to the audience, but he does speak eloquently about the importance of an Indian judge presiding over a criminal case. When Adela appears on the witness stand, she tells the story of how she came to be near Aziz at the bridge party. She says that she has come to see him because she is tired from tea with him. At this point Fielding comes up with a solution for her: she should return to their place of residence so they can discuss the matter further. But when she arrives, she finds out that Mr. Gardiner has been taken away by his own son who was supposed to take care of her. Mrs. Moorhouse refuses to allow her to attend the court hearing; she wants to go home instead. Fielding and the other Englishmen are saddened by the death of their witness, Adela Moore. Hamidullah has news for them as well: her mother is dead. She died in a shipwreck during the voyage to India. The narrator notes that Fielding feels guilty about having let Adela go; he does not want his friend to go through with such an emotional rollercoaster. He also realizes that they do not have much in common apart from each other. They become closer because of religious differences between themselves and the Indian community. Their relationship develops further when Fielding tries to convince Aziz to allow Adela to attend Government College so that she will not be forced back into England. Meanwhile, Arabella continues to make fun of Fielding's Indian friends, who treat him cruelly even though he tried to help her out at the trial. In Chapter XXIX, it turns out that both men are deeply affected by the loss of their mentor, Professor Godbole. When Fielding returns home, he discovers that Aziz has been blackmailing Adela while she was away on a trip to Europe. This causes tension between the two men. Fielding attends the masjid, but when he returns home, he finds that Aziz and Fielding have been misunderstanding one another. He tells Aziz that he is leaving for England to pursue a career as a doctor. The next day, Fielding writes Aziz a letter in which he accuses Aziz of being a snotty old man who does not like women. Afterward, he takes his children with him on a trip to Europe. On the way, he stops by Mau, where he meets up with Fielding again. They are introduced to each other through their mutual respect and admiration of each other; they also learn from each other about the relationship between the two men. As soon as Fielding leaves, an all-Indian religious procession begins. It ends at sunset. At this point, it has begun to rain. Meanwhile, fielding receives a mysterious letter from Fielding saying that he will be returning to India soon. advertisement",4.179614569174225,0.28807946520136185
The Plague," The text of The Plague is divided into five parts. In the town of Oran, thousands of rats, initially unnoticed by the populace, begin to die in the streets. A hysteria develops soon afterward, causing the local newspapers to report the incident. Authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats, unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague. The main character, Dr. Bernard Rieux, lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the building's concierge, M. Michel, a confidante, dies from a fever. Dr. Rieux consults his colleague, Castel, about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town. They both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory, but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death. However, as more and more deaths quickly ensue, it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic. Authorities, including the Prefect, M. Othon, are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take. Official notices enacting control measures are posted, but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation. A ""special ward"" is opened at the hospital, but its 80 beds are filled within three days. As the death toll begins to rise, more desperate measures are taken. Homes are quarantined; corpses and burials are strictly supervised. A supply of plague serum finally arrives, but there is only enough to treat existing cases and the country's emergency reserves are depleted. When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared. The town is sealed off. The town gates are shut, rail travel is prohibited, and all mail service is suspended. The use of telephone lines is restricted only to ""urgent"" calls, leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town. The separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople, who begin to feel isolated and introverted, and the plague begins to affect various characters. One character, Raymond Rambert, devises a plan to escape the city to join his lover in Paris after city officials refuse his request to leave. He befriends some criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city. Another character, Father Paneloux, uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of God punishing the citizens' sinful nature. His diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town, who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances. Cottard, a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide yet fearful of being arrested, becomes wealthy as a major smuggler. Meanwhile, Dr. Rieux, a vacationer Jean Tarrou, and a civil servant Joseph Grand exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital. Rambert informs Tarrou of his escape plan, but when Tarrou tells him that others in the city, including Dr. Rieux, also have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see, Rambert becomes sympathetic and changes his mind. He then decides to join Tarrou and Dr. Rieux to help fight the epidemic. In mid-August, the situation continues to worsen. People try to escape the town, but some are shot by armed sentries. Violence and looting break out on a small scale, and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew. Funerals are conducted with more and more speed, no ceremony, and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased. The inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation; despondent, they waste away emotionally as well as physically. In September and October, the town remains at the mercy of the plague. Rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wife's condition is worsening. He also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work. Cottard, on the other hand, seems to flourish during the plague, because it gives him a sense of being connected to others, since everybody faces the same danger. Cottard and Tarrou attend a performance of Gluck's opera Orpheus and Eurydice, but the actor portraying Orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance. Rambert finally has a chance to escape, but he decides to stay, saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left. Towards the end of October, Castel's new anti-plague serum is tried for the first time, but it cannot save the life of Othon's young son, who suffers greatly, as Paneloux, Rieux, and Tarrou look on in horror. Paneloux, who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague, gives a second sermon. He addresses the problem of an innocent child's suffering and says it is a test of a Christian's faith, since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything. He urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague. A few days after the sermon, Paneloux is taken ill. His symptoms do not conform to those of the plague, but the disease still proves fatal. Tarrou and Rambert visit one of the isolation camps, where they meet Othon. When Othon's period of quarantine ends, he elects to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son. Tarrou tells Rieux the story of his life, and the two men go swimming together in the sea. Grand catches the plague and instructs Rieux to burn all his papers. But Grand makes an unexpected recovery, and deaths from the plague start to decline. By late January, the plague is in full retreat, and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates. Othon, however, does not escape death from the disease. Cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic, from which he has profited by shady dealings. Two government employees approach him, and he flees. Despite the epidemic's ending, Tarrou contracts the plague and dies after an heroic struggle. Rieux's wife also dies. In February, the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities. Rambert is reunited with his wife. Rieux reveals that he is the narrator of the chronicle and that he tried to present an objective view of the events. Cottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home. He is arrested. Grand begins working on his sentence again. Rieux reflects on the epidemic and reaches the conclusion that there is more to admire than to despise in humans.
","""The Plague"" is the first volume of a satirical e-book, and it was published in August of that year by Analog Science Fiction. The text is an extended edition of ""Analog Science Fact/Fiction February 1961"" with additional information added by Teddy Keller. In this book, all the major players in the military are involved in creating a public health crisis for the American people. They must respond immediately to any outbreaks of disease or illness caused by a non-com; they must contact local authorities, doctors, nurses, and other emergency personnel who will be on the front lines during the crisis. A surgeon general announces that he has placed two officers on special duty--the brigadier general and the lieutenant colonel--to investigate the situation. He informs them that if they fail to do so, their duties will be suspended until they find a suitable replacement. Meanwhile, the narrator notes that there have been no official releases from the hospital regarding the outbreak of the plague due to the fact that none of the medical personnel were able to attend the crisis meeting. This makes the narrator wonder about the future of the war.",0.030826109436090928,0.1595441563681708
Venus in Furs," The framing story concerns a man who dreams of speaking to Venus about love while she wears furs. The unnamed narrator tells his dreams to a friend, Severin, who tells him how to break him of his fascination with cruel women by reading a manuscript, Memoirs of a Suprasensual Man. This manuscript tells of a man, Severin von Kusiemski, who is so infatuated with a woman, Wanda von Dunajew, that he asks to be her slave, and encourages her to treat him in progressively more degrading ways. At first Wanda does not understand or accede to the request, but after humouring Severin a bit she finds the advantages of the method to be interesting and enthusiastically embraces the idea, although at the same time she disdains Severin for allowing her to do so. Severin describes his feelings during these experiences as suprasensuality. Severin and Wanda travel to Florence. Along the way, Severin takes the generic Russian servant's name of ""Gregor"" and the role of Wanda's servant. In Florence, Wanda treats him brutally as a servant, and recruits a trio of African women to dominate him. The relationship arrives at a crisis when Wanda herself meets a man to whom she would like to submit, a Byronic hero known as Alexis Papadopolis. At the end of the book, Severin, humiliated by Wanda's new lover, loses the desire to submit. He says of Wanda:
","This chapter introduces the reader to Ritter. Ritter is a Francophobe who has lived in Galicia since 1836, and he died in 1895 at the age of sixty-five. He was an Austrian Jew originally from Galicia but moved to Paris in 1855. His work on psycho-sensual literature dates back more than a century. The main focus of his works is Venus in Furst, which focuses on romantic love between a woman and a man. In this chapter, Ritter explains how he came to be attracted to Wanda after meeting her as a young girl with a long hair and a curving nose. When she asks him why he loves her, he tells her that it is because they are lovers. She responds by saying that men can only have so much pleasure if they allow themselves to be dominated by women. This makes Ritter even more determined to find a way to win her. Wanda convinces Severin that they should live as if they were married. She tells him that he will become her husband and she will become Severin's wife. For the past ten days, Severino has been with Wanda every day except during the night. At one point in the course of their conversation, she asks Severin whether he would like to possess her or not. He replies that he does not want to because he loves her so much. After a while, though, his love for her diminishes. When she leaves, he becomes even more entranced by her beauty and sensuality; this arouses his interest in her. They spend many happy hours together despite the fact that she is away from home. One day, she sends him a note saying that she wants him to come visit her at least once a month. A few weeks later, she invites him to join her when she lives with another woman. The next day, he goes to see her. While there, he sees blood trickling from her eyes. A Russian prince makes his first visit to the Tazzaevs on Wanda's behalf. He immediately becomes attracted to her, but when she tells him that she wants to know more about him, he refuses to listen or even allow her to speak with him. After a few days of this behavior, she finally agrees to give up her relationship with Ganymede and become his mistress. The next day, they board a train bound for Florence. They arrive in Florence just before midnight. During their honeymoon, both women are forced to sleep in uncomfortable sleeping cubicles. For the next month, they go house hunting together. At one point, they meet Wanda at her apartment. She instructs them to take her to her bedroom where she will be confined until she can find a place to live again. As long as she is there, everything goes according to plan. Wanda wakes up Severin and tells him that she wants him to sleep in her house. She also instructs him to go and dress in Carpathia, which reminds him of how beautiful Wanda used to be when they were lovers. He falls asleep listening to Wanda speak to him about his feelings for her. The next morning, the maid notices that Wanda has brought along a painter whom she is going to meet later that day at the theater. This makes her even more determined to get rid of him because she knows he will eventually kill her. That night, she gives birth to a beautiful lioness named Wanda herself. A young man named Gregor arrives on his way to see Wanda while she is taking care of another client. Afterward, she takes him by the hand and leads him into the bedroom where he finds Wanda sitting with a book close to her heart. They continue to talk until the end of the conversation. advertisement",1.6515747710391748,0.22993491975004834
The Jungle," The main character in the book is a Lithuanian man called Jurgis Rudkus, an immigrant to the United States trying to make ends meet. The book begins describing the wedding feast beginning at four o'clock after the marriage in Chicago of Jurgis to a fifteen year old Lithuanian girl named Ona Lukoszaite whom he had known from his Lithuanian days. The second chapter goes back to when Jurgis and Ona were in Lithuania before they married and Jurgis's courtship of her, the death of her father, and their decision to start dating and eventually immigrate to the United States along with her stepmother Teta Elzbieta, and their extended family after hearing how their relative Jokubas Szedvilas is making money there. In the second and third chapters Jurgis and Ona settle in Chicago's infamous Packingtown district, where from the start, Jurgis takes a job at Brown's slaughterhouse. (Brown was a pseudonym for Armour and Company.) Jurgis believes when he immigrates to the United States that it will be a land of more freedom, but soon his employer's treatment of him disappoints him. Alas, they have to make compromises and concessions to survive. Due partly to illiteracy in English, they quickly make a series of bad decisions that cause them to go deep into debt and fall prey to con men. The most devastating decision comes when, in hopes of owning their own home, the family falls victim to a predatory lending scheme that exhausts all their remaining savings on the down-payment for a sub-standard slum house that (by design) they cannot possibly afford. The family is evicted and their money taken, leaving them truly devastated. The family had formerly envisioned that Jurgis alone would be able to support them in the United States, but one by one, all of them&mdash;the women, the young children, and Jurgis' sick father&mdash;have to find jobs in order to contribute to the meager family income. As the novel progresses, the jobs and means the family uses to stay alive slowly and inevitably lead to their physical and moral decay. A series of unfortunate events&mdash;accidents at work, along with a number of deaths in the family that under normal circumstances could have been prevented&mdash;leads the family further toward catastrophe. One injury results in Jurgis being fired; he later takes a job at Durham's fertilizer plant. (Durham was a pseudonym for Swift and Company.) The family's tragedies cumulate when Ona confesses to Jurgis, who is suspicious of her frequent absences from home, that her boss, Phil Connor, had raped her, and made her job dependent on her giving him sexual favors. In revenge, Jurgis later attacks Connor, leading to his arrest and imprisonment by the corrupt judge Pat Callahan, who sides with Connor against Jurgis. After his stint in jail, Jurgis returns home, only to find out that his family has been evicted. He finds his family at a relative's house; Jurgis also discovers Ona in labor with her second child. Ona dies in childbirth from blood loss at the age of eighteen. Jurgis lacked money to pay for a doctor; so Ona has to rely on the greedy and incompetent Madame Haupt, whose carelessness leads to Ona's death. Soon after their first child drowns in the muddy street, causing Jurgis to flee the city in utter despair and turn to drinking. At first the mere presence of fresh air is balm to his soul, but his brief sojourn as a hobo in rural United States shows him that there is really no escape&mdash;even farmers turn their workers away when the harvest is finished. Jurgis returns to Chicago and holds down a succession of jobs outside the meat packing industry&mdash;digging tunnels, as a political hack, and as a con-man&mdash;but injuries on the job, his past and his innate sense of personal integrity continue to haunt him, and he drifts without direction. One night, while looking for a warm and dry refuge, he wanders into a lecture being given by a charismatic Socialist orator, and finds a sense of community and purpose. Socialism and strong labor unions are the answer to the evils that he, his family and their fellow sufferers have had to endure. A fellow socialist employs him, and he resumes his support of his wife's family, although some of them are damaged beyond repair. The book ends with another socialist rally, which comes on the heels of several recent political victories. The speaker encourages his comrades to keep fighting for victories, chanting ""Chicago will be ours!""
","The wedding feast takes place in the back of a converted saloon. The celebration begins and ends at four o'clock, when Ona Lydias is introduced. Shepherds her niece through the crowded hallways and into the banquet hall where she waits with her cousin for the entire family to enjoy the food and drink. After the meal, guests begin arriving from all over the city. Many of them are young men who work as beef-bboners; others are old people who have lost their jobs due to alcohol poisoning. At one point during the party, Jugis tells Ona that he will make more money by working harder. In the summer of 1855, Jonas Szedlago leaves Vilnius to go live in America with his friend Marija and their two children. On the way, they meet a policeman who tries to arrest them for trespassing on railroad tracks. They learn that Chicago is where they will stay for the time being. The next day, they board a train headed for New York City. Once there, they find themselves surrounded by ""shabby little buildings"" full of dirty, rotten goods. In an attempt to escape, Jonas runs away from the police and hides himself behind a tree. When he comes back, he tells everyone that he has found a job as a meat packing agent. He also tells everyone else that it is not too expensive because all the packing companies sell their wares directly to the American marketplaces. During this vacation period, Jonas travels to see the sights firsthand. While at the packing plant, Jonas sees a giant iron wheel driving a large portion of beef through the factory floor. It is then lowered into a chilling room so that the animals won't get sick during the meal. Jonas watches the entire process unfold before him. The family purchases a house from an agent who tells them they can buy it for as little as $15.00 a month and pay no rent at all. They are shocked to learn that they will be forced to rent the house out in order to make ends meet. The agents advise them to wait until they have more time before making their purchase, which takes place between Thursday and Sunday evening. After much debate, they finally agree to go through with the purchase once again. This time, though, the real estate agent warns them that there may be some problems with the lease on the house if they do not pay the mortgage. Onas is particularly upset when he learns that his stepmother has been injured during the process of picking up the pieces of furniture used in the houses. He also learns that Antanas Rudeius serves as one of those ""grumblers,"" or old witches. The chapter opens with a description of the Packingtoy house. According to the narrator, it is 15 years old and has nothing new on it except the paint that needs to be replaced every two years or so. The story goes something like this: When the family first bought the place, they expected to lose their house because no one would pay for it. However, after four failed attempts, they are finally able to raise the money enough to pay off the mortgage. They now have seven dollars left over from the sale of the previous house. This puts them over the $1,000 mark. Meanwhile, Stanislavskiene continues to work as a dishwasher at Brown's grocery store. He also works as a violinist in a nearby saloon. During the winter, he begins to bleed profusely from frostbite caused by salt peter, a chemical used to kill insects. After several months of constant suffering, his blood pressure drops dangerously low. In order to keep him from getting frostbite, Jugis must go to various saloons and buy alcohol. The union movement begins to take hold of the American working class. They begin to organize meetings in order to get their members to join, and by organizing these meetings, they can make a real impact on the packer community. The union movement also creates an opportunity for immigrants to gain access to the U.S. political system, which allows them to bypass the shackling industry and instead become part-time laborers who work as night watchmen at local packing plants. In this way, immigrant workers are not only protected from disease but also able to communicate effectively with one another without fear of retribution. Meanwhile, Jimis learns that America does not just have a government; rather, it has a system based on graft and corruption. During the spring and summer months, the family is forced to live off the tens of thousands of dollars spent each year on food and medicine. On top of all this, there are still plenty of jobs available for immigrants because no one really knows what they're getting into yet. In the summer of 1855, Packedtown is in full swing again. The packers take on more new workers and are forced to cut back on wages. One day Marija happens upon a line of working women waiting for a bank to open. She takes advantage of this opportunity to get money from them by running into a group of them who want to withdraw their deposits at the bank. They do not have much money, so they set up a savings account. Meanwhile, Jonas has lost his job as a lard-mending machine operator due to a broken ankle. During these difficult times, Onas suffers an accident that causes him to lose both his left hand and right leg. He also suffers frostbite in his foot. In April, Jonas disappears. Jugis attempts to find work but is refused a job because he is too weak to walk or sit still long enough to rest. A few weeks later, Stanislavas' leg gets seriously injured during a snowstorm. It turns out that the injury was caused by a faulty electric current. In the summer of the following year, laborers at the fertilizer plant become increasingly desperate for work. The family begins to prepare for the arrival of their children, who will attend school in order to earn a living. However, due to the difficulty of shoveling fertilizer from the mill into carts full of people waiting to buy it, many young men are forced to work as sous-chefs or waitresses on the factory floor. Many of these jobs include picking up discarded meat and preparing it for later consumption. During this time period, Ona is pregnant with her first child. She suffers from severe headaches and nervousness; she also suffers from periods of convulsion that lead her to cry out in pain. When Ona finally comes home, she tells Jurgys that she has had an accident during the course of the nightmarish pregnancy. He believes her but does not believe her until he hears her story. The next morning, after being locked up for the past two months, Darnay makes his way back to Chicago. He arrives at the police station and is told that he has a warrant out for assault on him. When he leaves the station, he finds Connor waiting for him outside in the loading yard. Connor tells Jurgys that they will lose their house if Connor doesn't take care of them soon enough. After Connor leaves, Ona's father-in-law comes to see her and says that Connor tried to seduce Ona while she was pregnant. The father then calls Forster into testimony about how Connor treated Ona during an extended period of time when Ona wasn't around. Then one day, StanislOVas shows up at the jail looking very disheveled. It turns out that this man is Jack Donnithorne, another convicted felon who had served time in prison for robbing a shipping company. In other words, it looks like there is a fire going on in the prison. The narrator describes the aftermath of the earthquake and its effects on the family. He notes that Ona's death has been a turning point in her life, as she was forced to give birth to an illegitimate child. The narrator also paints a vivid picture of how people react when they hear or see their loved ones crying out in front of them. When Marija comes to pick up some food from the kitchen counter, she finds Ona dead. She cries out again for help, but is met only with derision by the men at the fertilizer plant who tell her it is too late. They take her body back to the factory and place her in a locked garret so that she can have time to think before taking care of her sick husband. Meanwhile, Elzieta continues to live off the money given to her by her former lover Jonas. Finally, after months of searching for work, he finally gets a job selling papers in a fertilizer plant. But there are no jobs for him because his wages are way too high. In order to make ends meet, Elizieta sends Jurgys to look for work downtown. After a few months, the Tramp is offered a job at the local steelworks. He works there for three weeks and earns a good deal of money by working alongside other laborers. After several more failed attempts, he finally gets a job as a helper in a neighboring mill. The work is very demanding and repetitive, with many hours spent on day-to-day grinds and grinding machines. During this time period, Elzieta sends Antanas to live with her family in a lodging house. When Antanas awakens one morning, he finds that his father has drowned in the stock market. Reluctant to leave his family behind, Jaquenetta drives him home. The Underground Man In Chicago One Saturday night, after a rainstorm, Jim finds shelter from the elements in a dilapidated house near a workingman's home. The owner of the home informs Jim that his wife and youngest child have been sleeping outdoors while he takes a bath in a well-stocked laundry room. After Jim falls asleep, he wakes up to find Freddie Jones, who tells him that he is going to be spending Christmas with his fiancee. He also learns that Freddie has broken his arm doing some heavy lifting on the railroad tracks. When Freddie leaves for the holiday season, they all meet again at a crowded bus stop. Freddie asks Jurgys if he can borrow money so that he can buy food for himself when he needs it. They go off to a large hall full of high-quality banquet halls filled with gambling tables, beer gardens, and other luxuries. Finally, they arrive at a small apartment where Freddie gives Jurgius a $100 bill. Failing to pay, Freddie drinks the entire contents down into his mouth. Jurgis meets Jack Duanes, who tells him all about his family and the illegal activities of the gambling industry in Chicago. He also explains to Duane how he got blacklisted for soliciting a prostitute while working as a laborer at a pawnshop. Jugis is then offered a job as a member of the local Republican Party, but refuses to accept it until Duane convinces him to do so. When Duane finally agrees to go along with this plan, Jurgeris takes advantage of the opportunity presented to him by Scully to get some money from the gambling business. In order to make ends meet, however--and perhaps more importantly, to keep himself safe during an election year when no one seems to care that much about the outcome of the election--he hires Duane's old pal, Bush Harper, who helps him find a job running a gambling establishment. During the election season, Jim becomes embroiled in a prostitution scandal, which results in ten dollars in fines and a $10,000 fine. The strike continues for several more weeks. Finally, in June, the union demands a vote on whether or not to hold off the strike until the strike is over. The packers refuse to pay the workers' wages and instead force them to work as scabbing laborers. On his first day back at work, Jim Scully asks him why he doesn't just stick with his job. Scully explains that it's because they need ""good men"" who can stand by their side. After two hours of this conversation, Jugis gives up his job and goes outside to get some beer. He tells Scully that he has come to Chicago to try to find a job so he can help out Mike Scully. Scully agrees to go along with the plan. Soon enough, Jorgis finds himself in the middle of a political rally. It turns out that there is a strike going on all around the country between five and six weeks when the voters will elect a President. This puts Jurgi in a unique position to make an impact on the lives of countless black people throughout the country. In order to counteract this effect, Jergis hires a prostitute named Alena from a nearby saloon. Alena reveals herself as Jessica Connor, one of Mulder Scully's top lieutenants. She says that she is pregnant and wants to be married. When her name is called, Harper grants her permission to marry Jessica. They are married shortly thereafter. After the shooting, Jugis goes to visit Marija and finds her in a dilapidated brownstone home. She tells him that she lives with Stanislas Tetaislovskas, Stanislaus' brother-in-law, and another relative of hers. He is then taken to a small cell where he meets Marija's cousin, Alexandra Jerenski. During their conversation, they discuss the horrors of life in Leningrad. They both agree that there must be some kind of end to this cycle of oppression. The narrator concludes by stating that these are the very conditions for which slavery has been sown. In order to counterbalance his argument, Zdravko suggests that all women should be allowed to work as maids instead of prostitutes. This seems like a good idea at the time; however, it does not seem to have any effect on Marija or her family during this chapter. At last, Dr. Barlow announces that Madame Pernelle has arranged for Marija to take over the position of supervising nursemaid. Jurenski immediately realizes that such an end will not be in sight. The Socialist Party of America rallies its members in order to organize and support the Socialist Party. The meeting ends with a speech by Ostrinkins, a Polish orator who has been traveling throughout the U.S. since the Civil War. After the speech, an adoring crowd gathers at the convention floor for a night of drinking and socializing. Comrade Josephus Ostrinkski, a former Socialist Party official, meets Jurgius and introduces him to his new employer, Comrade Tommy Hinds . Over the course of the next few weeks, Jim becomes increasingly disillusioned with socialism. He begins to attend Socialist meetings and become involved in socialist politics. The editor of an Eastern magazine asks Adams and Maynard to start a discussion about ""pure food"" in which they will discuss religion. Jugis is nervous because he has never spoken to women before. He does not understand the concept of religion, so he assumes that they are Socialists or communists. The editor disagrees with this interpretation, claiming that there must be some kind of class distinction between people who have money and those who don't. Lucas argues that religion is the best defense against all forms of oppression, pointing out that if a woman could dictate terms for herself and her family, then she would be free to do whatever she wants with her life. This debate continues into the election of the next year. In order to determine whether socialism will actually work, the narrator explains that it will certainly not. advertisement",1.5628712649910241,0.20186112684794966
The Magician," The story takes place in Ossining, New York. Ed Japhet is sixteen years old, and he is a bright, articulate boy. His father Terence teaches at his school. Ed's hobby is performing magic tricks, hence he is the ""magician"" of the title. One evening, Ed performs in front of the school on prom night, and aggravates school hoodlum Urek. Urek and his gang wait for Ed that night as he is about to go home with his dad and girlfriend. Urek attacks Ed and nearly kills him. Urek is eventually arrested on a charge of serious assault. At first this looks like a straightforward case. But Urek's dad happens to have a lawyer named Thomassy, who has made it his life's work to defend the low-lifes and the criminals of the area - and to get them off the hook. When Thomassy started his promising career as a lawyer he joined a firm with WASP surnames deliberately. They took him on and he became their most brilliant lawyer. However, the senior partner told him that as an Armenian he would never get promoted, at least while he was alive. Thomassy, stung, left and decided to follow a controversial path defending the most undesirable characters in society. He sends a birthday card every year to the old senior partner, as if to say, ""You still alive?"" As the story unfolds, the reader becomes uncomfortably aware of how an event can be interpreted by the law. It seems as though Ed has the advantage, he is talented, with a nice family and girlfriend, horribly attacked and nearly killed by a brute. But Thomassy manages to play the attack down: he discredits witnesses, intimidates others, and portrays Urek as acting only in self defense. Now the reader is unsure who the actual ""magician"" of the title really is. Also involved is German Jewish Psychiatrist Koch, who has taken an interest in the case. His involvement gives the reader an opportunity to see Urek in more depth, as previously he is portrayed as a mindless, violent and inarticulate monster. Nothing can excuse what he has done, but Koch offers more insight as to why he did it. The book ends on a violent note. Urek walks free from the assault charge and proceeds to attack Ed again, this time by hiding in Terence's car and leaping out at Ed. Ed, newly trained in Karate, can now defend himself against the thuggish Urek, with devastating results. Terence Japhet knows exactly whom to call. The book is written in the third person narrative style, but interspersed at intervals throughout the story are ""comments"" provided by the key characters. They are written in the style of statements, but the reader never knows to whom they are directed.
","In this chapter, Arthur begins his story. He is a thirty-year-old Englishman who has just passed medical school and is now practicing medicine in London. After passing the examinations required for him to practice medicine, he decides to abandon doctors and earn his living writing novels. He travels to Spain and spends a year there before returning to England as a professional writer. His first novel is published in 1897; his second is a play called A Man of Honor that fails to make much of a stir. In order to escape his banishment, Arthur visits Paris with Dr. Porhoizt, an art student at St. Luke's Hospital. They spend time together while Arthur works on his latest novel. Arthur asks about Margaret, whom he sees sitting across from him. She tells him that she loves him very much. Arthur then goes to see Madame Rouge , her mistress. The two sit down to eat tea together. Arthur admires Madame Ragueneau, whose beauty reminds him of Caius de Guiche . Susie tries to get Arthur to talk to Margaret about how beautiful she is. Arthur also talks about Mr. O'Brien, one of Arthur's painters. Arthur says that if Margaret ever marries him, they will have to marry separately. Haddo shows up at the inn. He pretends to be a professional magician, but when he sees Susie and Margaret looking at him suspiciously, he tells them that he is from Eastern Europe. They all go in search of clues as to his origins and where he came from. The men are introduced to Arthur, who introduces them to Dr Poyser, Monsieur Borro, Arthur's old friend, and Sir Ivanhoe. Then it is time for the English party to head off to the Paris fair. There, they find out that there is a traveling circus going on around the city. And guess what? Haddoes latest addition to the show is a rattlesnake-like creature called Zohar . It is described as ""a kind of grotesque creature"" , which means it resembles snakes or porcine  only slightly more sinister. In fact, its name comes from Casanova, the famous Egyptian antiquities dealer whose work has been cited in several books by various scholars. But this is not the first time Oliver has come up with such outlandish stories. Oliver arrives at the Burdons' studio to find Susie and Arthur there. He tells them about his experiences in Alexandria, and explains how he came to know that nothing could possibly be certain. They are all very impressed by his ability to see things through a telescope, but they do not understand why he is interested in science so much when he has no real understanding of what it means to be an educated man. Oliver also relates some of his father's occultist-related happenings. In 1856, Alphonse Louis Constant, a French physician who had come to England as a missionary during the Civil War, was sent to England on a mission to discover the secret of the Transylvania slave trade. Upon arriving in England, Arthur meets Dr. Porhet, who takes him under his wing for a tour of the abbey grounds. The narrator notes that this tour lasted for only twenty-two days. During this time, both men have become familiar with each other. Haddo apologizes to Margaret for kicking the dog. Margaret tries to reason with him, telling him that he has no malice or intention for what he did. He merely looks at her and makes an inhuman smile. Margaret is astounded by Haddoo's apology but can do nothing to stop him from continuing his assault on Arthur. Margaret receives a message from Nancy Clerk asking her to meet them at the train station two days later. She meets Oliver in the middle of the night while waiting for the train. They begin talking about art and life together. Oliver tells Margaret that she must go to Paris because he wants her to marry him. Margaret cannot resist this temptation. She hurries to find out where they are married. Margaret begins to realize that her relationship with Arthur has changed. She no longer envisions him as dull and dull; rather, she compares him to the ravishing figure of Mr. Bulstrode. Margaret continues to make plans for their future together. One day, on a visit to Paris, she sees Susie's beautiful young maidservant sitting down by herself. The maid is so engrossed in her sensual beauty that Margaret can barely stand it. They go to St. Sulphice where they sit down to have a private chat. Margaret tells Arthur that she will marry him whenever he chooses. Arthur accepts this offer without hesitation. On his way home, he stops at Mrs. Bloomfield who informs him that Margaret has married Oliver. He realizes that Margaret does not love him but loves him anyway. In an attempt to clear up any misunderstandings, he invites Susie over for dinner. Afterward, he asks her to meet him in London. At midnight, after much discussion, they agree to meet there. Arthur asks Susie to come with him to see the opera. She agrees and they go out for a drink together. Arthur tells Susie that he wants her to meet his wife and son-in-law, who will be there on Thursday because of Tristan's upcoming visit. He invites Susie along as well. They all agree to meet in the opera hall. Arthur is so engrossed in his music that he can hardly stand it. Afterward, he takes Susie back to London where she has been spending most of her time with Margaret Haddon. Margaret becomes hysterical at the thought of being separated from her husband again. Arthur tries to help Margaret by asking her to visit the local doctor, Dr. Poyser. The doctor convinces Margaret not to go through with the divorce proceedings. Arthur then goes to England to try to track down Margaret. There, he finds her in a dilapidated old boarding house called Venning. Here, he learns that Margaret has been taken to an insane asylum. Arthur wanders around Skene looking for Margaret. He comes across a bench and sits down on it, pretending to be someone else. Margaret does not recognize him at first, but then she recognizes him as the Squire of Harlingen. Arthur explains that he has come to see Margaret because he is ""flesh and blood"" . She tells him that she wants to go with him so they can figure out how to kill him. They arrive in London just before dark, and are told that Margaret has died from an accidental drowning. The Squire asks them to let him know if there is anything suspicious about Margaret's death. Arthur agrees to help. But when he gets back to England, he realizes that he cannot do anything until he figures out who Margaret really is. So he goes to his lodgings where he meets Dr Porhomët , who also happens to be very close to Margaret herself. In this conversation, Arthur learns that Margaret had been poisoned three weeks earlier. This news troubles Susie greatly; she worries that Arthur will die without her knowledge. Meanwhile, Mr. Burlingen tries to convince Arthur that Margaret probably died from heart disease or some other mysterious ailment. Arthur refuses to listen to any of this nonsense. Susie is seized with anger at the cruelty inflicted upon her by Arthur. She moves forward and challenges him to tell them what he wants to do. He refuses, saying that they can either stay or go without him. After a brief period of silence, suddenly a woman begins weeping. The men are unable to understand what she is saying, so they try their best to think of something else to prevent her from going. They cannot figure out what it is that she is crying about. Susiedo tries to stop Arthur from speaking in Latin, but this only makes his voice even more stilted. Finally, Arthur agrees to come with them as soon as possible. When they finally arrive at Skene, they find an abandoned house full of ancient weapons, armor, and other objects. Arthur opens the door to the crawlspace, which leads right into the room where Haddos body has been hidden. Inside, Arthur finds a large pile of human hair on top of a broken oak door. There also appears to be a bloodstain covering the entire room. Arthur removes the bloodstained cloth and puts it back on the door knob. Then, he unlocks the door and peeks inside. A huge red-crowned creature laces its way toward them through the dark night air. It immediately begins to shriek and beat at the glass before returning to normalcy. Arthur hurries away, followed by Susie who follows after him. advertisement",0.7690413791911698,0.161616157
Robur the Conqueror," The story begins with strange lights and sounds, including blaring trumpet music, reported in the skies all over the world. The events are capped by the mysterious appearance of black flags with gold suns atop tall historic landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty in New York, the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. These events are all the work of the mysterious Robur (the specific epithet for English Oak, Quercus robur, and figuratively taken to mean ""strength""), a brilliant inventor who intrudes on a meeting of a flight-enthusiast's club called the Weldon Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Members of the Weldon Institute are all firm believers that mankind shall master the skies using “lighter than air” craft, and that ""heavier than air"" craft such as airplanes and helicopters would be unfeasible. The institute has been constructing a giant dirigible called the Go-ahead, and are having a heated discussion of where to place its propeller (in front to pull it, or behind to push it) when Robur appears at the meeting and is admitted to speak to them. He chastises the group for being balloon-boosters when ""heavier than air"" flying apparatuses are the future. When asked if Robur himself has ""made conquest of the air,"" he states that he has, leading to him accepting the title ""Robur the Conqueror."" During his short time at the Weldon Institute Robur so incites the members, that they chase him outside. Just as they are about to attack him, Robur appears to vanish into the mob, but he has actually been borne away by a flying machine. Later that night Robur kidnaps the Weldon Institute's secretary, president, and the president’s valet. He takes them on board his ship, a huge rotorcraft vessel called the Albatross which has many vertical propellers so as to operate similar to a helicopter, and horizontal propellers to provide lateral movement. It bears the same black flag with golden sun that has been sighted on so many landmarks, and the music in the sky is explained to be one of the crewmen playing a trumpet. To demonstrate the vessel's superiority, Robur takes his captives around the world in the course of three weeks. The president and secretary are angry at Robur for kidnapping them and unwilling to admit that the Albatross is a fantastic vessel, or that their notions of ""lighter than air"" superiority are wrong. They demand that Robur release them, but he is aloof and always says that they shall remain as long as he desires it. Fearing they will be held captive forever, the two formulate plans to both escape and destroy the Albatross. After the horizontal propellers are damaged in a storm, the Albatross is anchored over the Chatham Islands for repairs. While the crew is busy at work, the two Weldon Institute members light a fuse and make their escape. They try to bring the valet with them but cannot find him, only later discovering that the coward had escaped already without them. The Albatross explodes and its wreckage, along with Robur and his crew, plunge into the ocean. Meanwhile the three escapees are safe on a small but inhabited island and are later rescued by a ship, then make a long journey back to Philadelphia. The Weldon Institute members return, and rather than describe their adventures or admit that Robur had created a flying machine greater than their expectations of the Go-ahead, they simply conclude the argument the group was having during their last meeting. Rather than have only one propeller to their dirigible, they decide to have one propeller in front and another behind similar to Robur's design. Seven months after their return the Go-ahead is completed and making its maiden voyage with the president, secretary, and an aeronaut. The speed and maneuverability of the dirigible marvels a huge crowd, but are trivial if compared to Robur’s Albatross. Suddenly, out of the sky there appears the Albatross. It is revealed that when the Albatross exploded, enough of it was intact so that at least some of the propellers operated and slowed its descent, saving the crew. The crew used the remains of the Albatross as a raft until they were rescued by a ship. Later, Robur and the crew made it back to his secret X Island, where the original Albatross had been built. Robur has built a new Albatross and now intends to exact revenge by showing it is superior to the Weldon Institute’s Goahead. The entirety of the final scene is described from the crowd's point of view. The Albatross begins circling the Go-ahead; the Go-ahead drops ballast and rises to fourteen thousand feet. The Albatross follows, still a circling menace. The Go-ahead is at the mercy of the Albatross because the Albatross is both faster and more maneuverable. Finally, the Go-ahead exceeds her pressure height, where her gas bags rupture. Losing her buoyancy gas, Go-ahead drops out of the sky like a rapidly descending kite. The Albatross stays alongside of Go-ahead as she falls, signalling the pilot and passengers of Go-head to come on board the Albatross. They refuse, but then the crew of Albatross again seizes them and brings them aboard the Albatross. Having demonstrated his rule over the skies, Robur returns the three men to the ground. In a speech, Robur says that nations are not yet fit for union. He cautions the crowd that it is evolution, not revolution that they should be seeking. He leaves with the promise that he will one day return to reveal his secrets of flight.
","Robur the Confessor The narrator describes a series of events that take place during the course of June and July in order to illustrate the magnitude of the phenomena. First, the narrator explains, there are two men named Phil Evans and Jem Chip , who claim to have witnessed the phenomenon but do not elaborate on its cause or how they came to know about it. Second, there is an even bigger disagreement over the precise position of the object: whether the object is an aerial creature or simply a flying capsule. After much debate, the group finally decides to elect Robur as president. He gives a speech explaining his reasons for choosing the name ""Robur"" and then announces that he has invented a revolutionary aerostatic device called the Go-Airhead, which will enable people to travel beyond Earth's orbit by using electric motors instead of conventional ones. In other words, Robur is a complete coward. In the middle of nowhere, six armed men pound into the backs of Uncle Prudence and Phil. The Weldon institute sends out a search party to find them but no one comes to their aid. They are taken to a large open field with an oval field in which they sit down side-by-side on a plank. As soon as they begin to talk, however, there is a loud buzzing sound that sounds like someone preparing to attack them. Six more men rush across the field, two carrying Frycollins, two holding him down, and one dragging him off by his own hand. Soon enough, all six men have been seized and gagged. At this point, it becomes clear that Robur has also been kidnapped. In retrospect, we realize how important Robur's invention was for aeronautical engineering: He had originally planned to build a flying machine using wood instead of metal, but decided instead to design a mechanical bird rather than relying on electricity. This innovation greatly improves the efficiency of the avionics system. By the time Robur appears on the 24 th of June at 5:00AM, the airship has already left Philadelphia. Robur and the crew attempt to escape by jumping aboard a large, fast ship called the Albatross in June. They encounter a dense fog that prevents them from doing much of anything; however, Robur manages to maneuver the ship through it despite the danger posed by the approaching storm. After some time, they are able to re-enters the U.S. on June 29, just before dawn. On June 30, the crew sees an enormous white whale swimming towards them. It is then discovered that the entire crew has been caught up in the fog caused by Robur's aerial attack. The group decides to try their luck at escaping with only a small amount of effort. In order to do so, they have to jump over several mountains and into the Indian Ocean during the course of four days. During these four days, they see nothing but beautiful scenery. After two days, Robur and his crew decide that they must blow up the airship. They decide to do so on July 24, the day before the scheduled launch date. The ship passes several islands in the Aleutian Islands and then lands in the Andes Mountains of South America. On July 30, an aerial warplane approaches the island of Antigua with a force of more than sixty-five miles per hour. A group of soldiers shoot down the flying machine as it speeds past them. Shortly afterwards, however , there is a strange sight: An albatross has come to rest over the course of seven days. It turns out that some men have been stranded on the island due to its unfettered passage. Robur pilots the Albatross and points it toward a populated island called Chatham. The ship is uninhabited at this time, so Robur sends out a signal to the crew that they need to get going. They do manage to make it there in time, but things are not looking too rosy for their liking. On July 27, the group sees an island called X-Island with a population of about 3,000 people. It seems as though Robur has stolen some dynamite from his cabin and used it to set the albatross free. He plans to leave the island on the next day, hoping to catch up with them by sunrise. However, when he reaches the island, he discovers that no one has been able to find them. There is also no way to reach them without damaging the ship. advertisement",2.9234455063052764,0.22014051024247386
Kim," Kim (Kimball O'Hara) is the orphaned son of an Irish soldier and a poor white mother who have both died in poverty. Living a vagabond existence in India under British rule in the late 19th century, Kim earns his living by begging and running small errands on the streets of Lahore. He occasionally works for Mahbub Ali, a Pashtun horse trader who is one of the native operatives of the British secret service. Kim is so immersed in the local culture, few realise he is a white child, though he carries a packet of documents from his father entrusted to him by an Indian woman who cared for him. Kim befriends an aged Tibetan Lama who is on a quest to free himself from the Wheel of Things by finding the legendary 'River of the Arrow'. Kim becomes his chela, or disciple, and accompanies him on his journey. On the way, Kim incidentally learns about parts of the Great Game and is recruited by Mahbub Ali to carry a message to the head of British intelligence in Umballa. Kim's trip with the lama along the Grand Trunk Road is the first great adventure in the novel. By chance, Kim's father's regimental chaplain identifies Kim by his Masonic certificate, which he wears around his neck, and Kim is forcibly separated from the lama. The lama insists that Kim should comply with the chaplain's plan because he believes it is in Kim's best interests, and the boy is sent to a top English school in Lucknow. The lama funds Kim's education. Throughout his years at school, Kim remains in contact with the holy man he has come to love. Kim also retains contact with his secret service connections and is trained in espionage (to be a surveyor) while on vacation from school by Lurgan Sahib, at his jewellery shop in Simla. As part of his training, Kim looks at a tray full of mixed objects and notes which have been added or taken away, a pastime still called Kim's Game, also called the Jewel Game. After three years of schooling, Kim is given a government appointment so that he can begin his role in the Great Game. Before this appointment begins however, he is granted time to take a much-deserved break. Kim rejoins the lama and at the behest of Kim's superior, Hurree Chunder Mookherjee, they make a trip to the Himalayas. Here the espionage and spiritual threads of the story collide, with the lama unwittingly falling into conflict with Russian intelligence agents. Kim obtains maps, papers, and other important items from the Russians working to undermine British control of the region. Mookherjee befriends the Russians under cover, acting as a guide and ensures that they do not recover the lost items. Kim, aided by some porters and villagers, helps to rescue the lama. The lama realizes that he has gone astray. His search for the 'River of the Arrow' should be taking place in the plains, not in the mountains, and he orders the porters to take them back. Here Kim and the lama are nursed back to health after their arduous journey. Kim delivers the Russian documents to Hurree, and a concerned Mahbub Ali comes to check on Kim. The lama finds his river and achieves Enlightenment. The reader is left to decide whether Kim will henceforth follow the prideful road of the Great Game, the spiritual way of Tibetan Buddhism, or a combination of the two. Kim himself has this to say: ""I am not a Sahib. I am thy chela.""
","The lama Kim is a white man who has served in the Indian army for seven years. His mother was a nursemaid, but she died when he was a young man. Kim sells his wares to religious men and then goes on to make money by pretending to be a beggar. The narrator tells us that this is what Kipling calls ""the most ancient of all his life."" He also talks about how important the Bible is to him because it gives him meaning and makes him feel like a human being. In chapter two, Kim travels to the train station where Mahbub Ali, an old beggar trader, lives. Kim meets Mahbub's lama , who introduces himself as the Red Lama. Kim explains that they need to find a way to cross the river Benares so that they can get to England together. They go to Sarajevo Station, which serves as the main stop for their journey. The lama and the Gurudwara go on their journey, stopping at several roadside inns in order to eat breakfast. While there, they are approached by an old soldier who tells them that he is a prisoner of the Insular Government. He also informs them that his regiment has been cut off from all its tickets due to inclement weather. The Lama explains that this is punishment for anyone who does not obey the orders of the government. They continue on their way until they reach Umballad, where they meet the local lama's cousin and his elder brother. After eating breakfast, Kim returns to the lodgings with food and money. When they return home, they find out that it is time for them to begin their journey again. The lama explains to Kim that the river, which he knows is cleansed of sin, leads to freedom. He then proceeds to tell a story about a naked child who has been orphaned and whose mother died before she could be reunited with her son. The narrator tells us that this child was accompanied by an old soldier named Khaiawar , who had come to see the Lama in order to give him advice on how to best serve his daughter. After listening for a long time, Kim notices that the young man does not seem to have any interest in learning or doing anything specific. Soon, however, they are accosted by four white men dressed in military clothes. They all agree to go with the woman to Buddh-gaya, where there will be no need for a dowager as long as she takes care of her family. The next morning, Kim finds Father Victor and Father Victor waiting for him outside the camp. Father Victor explains that he has found a boy who speaks English but is mistaken about the identity of the boy as being his own son. The boys agree to meet up with each other once they are out of sight of the others. They also discuss the possibility of becoming members of the Indian Regiment or joining the Muslim Brotherhood in order to better serve their cause. After three days of torture at the hands of Father Victor's men, Kim meets Father Victor again on the road home. He tells Father Victor that he must return to England where he will be treated like a member of the Regiment; Father Victor promises to send him back if he does not do so. As time passes, Kim becomes more and more aware of the injustice inflicted upon him by Northamptonshire authorities. An Englishman runs up to Kim and tells him that his horse has been stolen from the stable. The man asks where Kim's horse is located, but Kim refuses to give him the address. An Indian businessman buys Kim for a few dollars and sends him on his way. A month later, he meets Kim again in Lucknow as a young boy who has been orphaned because of an attack on his family by a white army. He also learns that O'Hara will be returning to India after three years at St. Xavier's School. After this, Kim begins to learn Urdu so that he can communicate with people in India. Soon, however, he realizes that he is alone among two hundred other precocious boys who have not yet graduated from school. Mahbub Ali tells Kim that he saw the commander of the Indian army, Creighton Smith, at a dinner. He then went to see him and read the stallion's pedigree. After reading the pedigree, Kim began to buy Mahbub from him. Eventually, Kim realized that this was all part of his plan to help Mahbub become a successful businessman in order to earn money for himself and his family. The next morning, Kim ventured out into the dark to find Lurgan-owned jewelry shop. While there, Kim spotted two men robbing a Hindu boy whom he pretended to be. When Kim asked them where they were going, they told him that they were on their way back to Sohrababad. They took Kim inside the shop so that he could talk to the young man. As soon as Kim left the store, though, someone called out to him asking where he was. It turned out to be Gurgan-Ali who sold some jeweled goods to Kim. This made Kim even more determined to get rid of the mystery man. The Babu informs Kim that he will be paid five hundred rupees for every story he tells of his adventures in the past three months and gives him five more rupees to keep him occupied. He then goes on to talk about education, which involves changing the color of a person's hair so that it looks different from what it used to look like. The narrator notes that this is an important aspect of the Bajrangi-Mohammedan religion as it relates to the concept of the Six Tribes of India. In order to help Kim get into the Indian Society, the narrator suggests that they should give him a special dress of honor--that is, one that would allow him to go wherever he desires without being recognized or questioned. The Journey to Enlightenment The Lama and Kim meet again on the train from Benares to Dehradun. He tells Kim that he has cured his son of a severe fever, which was caused by starvation and disease. Kim then takes the boy to the temple of the gods, where they perform a healing ritual. In this ritual, Kim also gives E23 an opium-curdling lama with whom he once worked as a sardine salesman. This lama explains that in order for Kim to be able to help him search for the missing letter, he must first provide them with food, shelter, and clothing before he can return to India. They all board the train bound for Delhi. The lama tells Kim that he is a friend of the world and asks him to help his daughter find her son. They travel for four days, stopping at many Indian villages in order to speak with each other. The narrator notes that these are not isolated places; rather, they all come from different parts of India. In this chapter, we learn more about the three main characters of the novel: Kim, Othello, and Gurudwara. These are the two holy men who have been living among the huts of the Bedouins for fifty years. Their relationship is cemented by their mutual understanding of one another. When they arrive at the Hills , they meet an old blind woman named Oshello, who has just had a stroke. She wants to know if there is anything she can do to help the blind man get back to health. As they walk toward Simla, they run into Hurree Bhaer, whom they call Babu . He says that he will take care of them until they reach Simla proper. The lama explains that the British have taken all their books and documents, including the King's letter. He also tells them that they will have to divide up the land among themselves if they want to make it as palatable as possible. Kim is able to help him by showing him a map of the mountains in order to give him an idea of where to find the papers he needs for his search. The narrator notes that some of these men are not very religious, but they do practice self-determining how best to get there. In other words, they don't know anything about religion or politics. They just assume that this is what the world is like. As Kim continues to tell the story of his trip to Shamlugh, another lama emerges from the bush with a wagon full of supplies: food, shelter, medicine, and clothing. It turns out that the Lama has been traveling through the mountains since late last year. And guess what? There are still plenty of Sahib women around. This chapter ends with a brief scene in which Kim meets the woman, Shamla, who is traveling with her husband and three other men. She explains that they will not be going to the mountains because of the disease she suffers from. She also tells them that if they stay on the highway for as long as they need to, she will take care of them until they return. The narrator notes that these are some of the most important points in the book. These include: 1) Getting food; 2) Providing shelter; 3) Observing the condition of one's body; 4) Refusing to give food or drink; 5) Trying to keep track of his health; 6) Hoseason 7) Attempting to maintain control of his own mind; 7) Reluctant to let go of any semblance of sanity; 8) Wanting to break free from all forms of self-hatred; 9) Keeping track of what he has eaten and drank; and 10) keeping track of how many horses he has sold; and finally, finally, getting rid of all his worldly possessions. advertisement",1.7586343987702928,0.24400416659994073

Memory," During a routine combat mission, Miles suffers an epileptic-like seizure, a lingering side effect of his recent death and cryo-revival. During the fit, his plasma arc is activated and he accidentally severs the legs of the courier he was sent to rescue. Terrified of the possible consequences if he lets his condition reach the ears of Simon Illyan, he falsifies the mission report to cover it up. However, Illyan has spies in place among his crew, Miles is caught out in his lies, and he is forced to resign from ImpSec. He is plunged into a state of deep depression. Meanwhile, Emperor Gregor, after years of refusing to marry any of the tall, slim, eligible Barrayaran ladies paraded in front of him by Alys Vorpatril, unexpectedly falls in love with a short, voluptuous Komarran, Laisa Toscane, a wealthy heiress and member of a Komarran economic delegation. Unfortunately, she was already in the sights of Duv Galeni, now an ImpSec commodore and friend of Miles. Being from Komarr brings Galeni under suspicion during later events. When Illyan suffers a sudden, crippling mental impairment, Miles suspects it is not natural. His attempts to investigate are blocked by ImpSec's acting chief, so he asks Gregor to assign an Imperial Auditor (a top-level troubleshooter with practically unlimited authority and answerable only to the Emperor). Gregor unexpectedly makes Miles himself a temporary Auditor. After Miles unravels the devious crime in remarkably quick time, his appointment is made permanent. Duv Galeni is cleared, becoming ImpSec's new Head of Komarran Affairs, and he discovers love in the form of Delia Koudelka.
","In this chapter, the narrator introduces a letter he received from Hal in which he explains how General Export fabricates pipe that can be shipped to Mars using only sheets. He also mentions Phyllas Exeter's arrival at the Pinnacle and her plan to build a hydrogen-powered airlock on Mars through a process called ""budgie"" . The narrator notes that these are some of the most important business decisions made by Genex; they're all about making sure their customers get what they pay for. In this scene, however, it seems like something is missing because Genex doesn't just want one piece of paper--it wants everything else. This chapter ends with a bawdier scene involving two men trying to help each other out. They both try to figure out exactly how things went wrong: first, there's a letter written by Hal explaining why Genex plans to build an underground hydrogen-fueled power station on Mars; second, there has to be someone who can track down and fix the problem before Genex decides to go after them. Finally, they agree to give each other the compact so they can start working together again.",0.6448106022053656,0.11042944288964607
Antony and Cleopatra," Mark Antony – one of the Triumvirs of Rome along with Octavian and Lepidus – has neglected his soldierly duties after being beguiled by Egypt's Queen, Cleopatra. He ignores Rome's domestic problems, including the fact that his third wife Fulvia rebelled against Octavian and then died. Octavian calls Antony back to Rome from Alexandria in order to help him fight against Sextus Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, three notorious pirates of the Mediterranean. At Alexandria, Cleopatra begs Antony not to go, and though he repeatedly affirms his deep passionate love for her, he eventually leaves. Back in Rome, a general brings forward the idea that Antony should marry Octavian's younger sister, Octavia, in order to cement the friendly bond between the two men. Antony's lieutenant Enobarbus, though, knows that Octavia can never satisfy him after Cleopatra. In a famous passage, he delineates Cleopatra's charms in paradoxical terms (rhetorical antithesis): ""Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale / Her infinite variety: other women cloy / The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry / Where most she satisfies."" A soothsayer warns Antony that he is sure to lose if he ever tries to fight Octavian. In Egypt, Cleopatra learns of Antony's marriage to Octavia and takes furious revenge upon the messenger that brings her the news. She grows content only when her courtiers assure her that Octavia is homely by Elizabethan standards: short, low-browed, round-faced and with bad hair. At a confrontation, the triumvirs parley with Pompey, and offer him a truce. He can retain Sicily and Sardinia, but he must help them ""rid the sea of pirates"" and send them tributes. After some hesitation Pompey accedes. They engage in a drunken celebration on Pompey's galley. Menas suggests to Pompey that he kill the three triumvirs and make himself ruler of Rome, but he refuses, finding it dishonourable. Later, Octavian and Lepidus break their truce with Pompey and war against him. This is unapproved by Antony, and he is furious. Antony returns to Alexandria, Egypt, and crowns Cleopatra and himself as rulers of Egypt and the eastern third of the Roman Empire (which was Antony's share as one of the triumvirs). He accuses Octavian of not giving him his fair share of Pompey's lands, and is angry that Lepidus, whom Octavian has imprisoned, is out of the triumvirate. Octavian agrees to the former demand, but otherwise is very displeased with what Antony has done. Antony prepares to battle Octavian. Enobarbus urges Antony to fight on land, where he has the advantage, instead of by sea, where the navy of Octavius is lighter, more mobile and better manned. Antony refuses, since Octavian has dared him to fight at sea. Cleopatra pledges her fleet to aid Antony. However, in the middle of the Battle of Actium, Cleopatra flees with her sixty ships, and Antony follows her, leaving his army to ruin. Ashamed of what he has done for the love of Cleopatra, Antony reproaches her for making him a coward, but also sets this true and deep love above all else, saying ""Give me a kiss; even this repays me."" Octavian sends a messenger to ask Cleopatra to give up Antony and come over to his side. She hesitates, and flirts with the messenger, when Antony walks in and angrily denounces her behaviour. He sends the messenger to be whipped. Eventually, he forgives Cleopatra and pledges to fight another battle for her, this time on land. On the eve of the battle, Antony's soldiers hear strange portents, which they interpret as the god Hercules abandoning his protection of Antony. Furthermore, Enobarbus, Antony's long-serving lieutenant, deserts him and goes over to Octavian's side. Rather than confiscating Enobarbus's goods, which he did not take with him when he fled to Octavian, Antony orders them to be sent to Enobarbus. Enobarbus is so overwhelmed by Antony's generosity, and so ashamed of his own disloyalty, that he dies from a broken heart. The battle goes well for Antony, until Octavian shifts it to a sea-fight. Once again, Antony loses when Cleopatra's ships break off action and flee – his own fleet surrenders, and he denounces Cleopatra: ""This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me."" He resolves to kill her for the treachery. Cleopatra decides that the only way to win back Antony's romance love is to send him word that she killed herself, dying with his name on her lips. She locks herself in her monument, and awaits Antony's return. Her plan fails: rather than rushing back in remorse to see the ""dead"" Cleopatra, Antony decides that his own life is no longer worth living. He begs one of his aides, Eros, to run him through with a sword, but Eros cannot bear to do it, and kills himself. Antony admires Eros' courage and attempts to do the same, but only succeeds in wounding himself. In great pain, he learns that Cleopatra is indeed alive. He is hoisted up to her in her monument, and dies in her arms. Octavian goes to Cleopatra, trying to persuade her to surrender. She angrily refuses, since she can imagine nothing worse than being led in triumph through the streets of Rome, proclaimed a villain for the ages. She imagines that ""the quick comedians / Extemporally will stage us, and present / Our Alexandrian revels: Antony / Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see / Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness / I' th' posture of a whore."" This speech is full of dramatic irony, because in Shakespeare's time Cleopatra really was played by a ""squeaking boy"", and Shakespeare's play does depict Antony's drunken revels. Cleopatra is betrayed and taken into custody by the Romans. She gives Octavian what she claims is a complete account of her wealth, but is betrayed by her treasurer, who claims she is holding treasure back. Octavian reassures her that he is not interested in her wealth, but Dolabella warns her that he intends to parade her at his triumph. Cleopatra resolves to kill herself, using the poison of an asp. She dies calmly and ecstatically, imagining how she will meet Antony again in the afterlife. Her serving maids, Iras and Charmian, also kill themselves. Octavian discovers the dead bodies and experiences conflicting emotions. Antony's and Cleopatra's deaths leave him free to become the first Roman Emperor, but he also feels some kind of sympathy for them: ""She shall be buried by her Antony. / No grave upon the earth shall clip in it / A pair so famous..."" He orders a public military funeral.
","Caesar sends messengers back to Rome, informing Antony that he has been disinherited. Octavia and her entourage arrive at Caesar's palace in Alexandria with Lepidius and his army. The messenger tells Antony the news concerning Fulvia and gives him a sum of money to complete the task. He leaves without giving any further details on what happened between Octavia/Cleopatra and Pompey or where he will be located. Meanwhile, an enobarbus servant brings word that Pompey plans to invade Egypt. Cleapatra is upset but manages to keep her composure throughout the entire conversation. She then asks for more gold so that she can use it to pay off her debts. At this point, Enobarbus enters and informs her that they plan to attack Pompey as soon as possible. They also warn her that Antony may not be able to defend himself against Pompey because of his infidelities. Pompey recognizes Pompey and asks him to shake hands with him. After a short conversation, Pompeyo says that Antony has agreed to the terms of the peace treaty. Caesar then leaves for Antony's camp in Alexandria where he will fight against Antony on his deathbed. Octatra enters accompanied by Enobarbs and her attendants. She tells them that she wants to see Antony before he goes to war. They all agree to go along as well Antony and Caesar enter Alexandria, where Antony has been captured. He tells his men that he wants to be taken alive so that they can prepare for the next battle. They decide to leave Antony in charge of their forces. Scarus is wounded but manages to lead them on a successful march through Alexandria. Cleogenes enters with news that Antony's fleet has yielded to Caesar. She sends her men to dig up the graves of those who have defected or died during the battle. Then she instructs them to bring Antony back to her camp as soon as possible. The scene ends with Antony dying. At this point Dolabella arrives bringing him food and water. A group of guardsmen brings Antony some figs before he dies. In the meantime, Phaedrus shows Antony the ropes which are attached to his body. When Antony realizes what has happened, he throws the figs onto the ground and begins to eat them. After Antony falls asleep, Dercetus enters carrying Antony offstage. He says goodbye to everyone except Cleo whom he loves very much. As time goes by, more and more people come to see Antony dead. advertisement",0.4708572525869073,0.23285898671261154
The Fortunes of Nigel," David Ramsay, a watchmaker, lives with his daughter Margaret on Fleet Street. He has two apprentices, Mr Vincent and Mr Tunstall. The two apprentices had run off to join in a street fray, and the goldsmith George Heriot was gossiping with Ramsay, when they brought in a fellow named Richie Moniplies with a broken head and very tattered garments. His wound having been dressed, he explained that he had come to London with his master Nigel Olifaunt to obtain payment of a debt owing to him by the king, and had been set upon as a stranger. Next morning Nigel received a visit, at his lodging with the chandler and his wife, from the goldsmith, who had known his father, and, having warned him that his estate was in danger, lent him money to appear in proper attire in Court. Heriot proceeded to Whitehall, and, having presented the young lord's petition, King James authorised him to advance part of the sum due, and promised to interest himself in his affairs. Dining with him the same day at the goldsmith's, in company with her father and Sir Mungo, Margaret lost her heart to Nigel, and employed Dame Ursula, the barber's wife, to ascertain all particulars respecting him. On being presented at Court by Lord Huntinglen he obtained an order for payment of his claim, and was introduced to the Duke of Buckingham, who announced himself as his enemy, and to the Duke's son, Lord Dalgarno, by whom he was initiated in all the vices of the aristocracy of that period, although warned by Richie, and by an anonymous letter. Meeting the Prince of Wales, later Charles I, in St. James's Park, attended by several courtiers, Nigel learnt from their manner, as well as from Sir Mungo, that he had been ill spoken of to Charles, upon which he challenged Dalgarno in the precincts of the Court, and was compelled to take refuge in Whitefriars to avoid arrest. Here he renewed his acquaintance with the barrister Lowestoffe, whom he had met at Beaujeu's tavern, and was assigned to the care of old Trapbois the lodging-house keeper and his daughter. On hearing of Nigel's trouble Margaret sought an interview with Lady Hermione, who occupied a suite of apartments in Heriot's mansion, and, having revealed her secret, was supplied with money to help him, being told at the same time by her confidant of the ill usage she had suffered from Lord Dalgarno. Vincent, who was in love with his master's daughter, and had been encouraged by Dame Ursula in extravagant habits, was now engaged by her to act as his rival's guide in effecting his escape from London. The same night old Trapbois was murdered by two ruffians who came to rob him; and, just as he had rescued the daughter, whom the bailiff Hildebrod had advised him to marry, Nigel was accosted by the apprentice, dressed as a waterman, from whom he learnt that a warrant had been issued for his apprehension, and that a boat was in readiness for him to give the king's officers the slip. Martha begged that she might accompany him, and, having secured her father's treasure, they were conducted by Vincent to the Temple Stairs. Having landed his companion at Paul's Wharf, where she was taken charge of by Moniplies, Nigel insisted on disembarking at Greenwich, instead of joining a Scotch vessel which was waiting for him at Gravesend; and having made his way to the park, he attended the king while he killed a deer, when he was recognised and consigned to the Tower. Presently Margaret, dressed as a boy, was shown into the same room; then the chandler came to claim his wife, whom he accused Nigel of having carried off; and, after he had dined, his friend Heriot arrived to reproach him with the position in which he had placed himself. He had also lost the king's warrant for his debt, and when his companion's disguise was detected, she saved him from further embarrassment by a full confession. One of her acts had been to present a petition to the king from Lady Hermione, on reading which he had commanded that Lord Dalgarno should instantly marry her; and another to offer such explanations respecting Nigel as induced his Majesty to pardon him. One hour only, however, remained within which to redeem his estates, when Moniplies appeared with the money, and Lord Dalgarno, who hoped to have secured them, was deprived of his revenge. The next day he was shot in Enfield Chase, where Captain Colepepper had planned to waylay him, as he was waiting, in company with Dame Nelly, and a page in charge of the treasure, to fight a duel with Nigel. Vincent and Lowestoffe, however, arrived in time to put two of the robbers to flight, while Moniplies killed the captain, who was suspected of having murdered Trapbois, and Christie recovered his wife. Nigel and Margaret were soon afterwards married; and as King James was honouring the feast with his presence, Richie presented Martha as his bride, who, at the same time, handed to the preserver of her life the deeds of the Glenvarloch estates, which she had freed from all liabilities, and the royal sign-manual which had been found among her father's papers.
","Sir Walter Scott uses the names of several characters in this chapter to illustrate his fictionalized version of events. The first character is a wealthy, well-to-do man who spends his fortune on establishing an Edinburgh hospital and educating hundreds of young people each year. The second character is George Herbert, a clergyman who becomes the squire of alsatia during James I's reign. The third character is Thomas Bjornstam, a member of the royal court from 1624 until his death in 1640. He is described as ""the ghost of William Barlow"" . The fourth character is named Shamwell , cousin of the Belfordes. The fifth character is unnamed but is mentioned only because he has been living in London for twenty years. The sixth character is identified only by initials. Finally, the final character is revealed through flashback. The Knifegrinder The narrator notes that he has not yet finished his work on this chapter, but promises to do so in the future. He begins with a poem about the Reformation, which took place during King James I's reign. During this time, many of the people of London who believed that English and Scots were separate states were moved to believe that they were united under one commonwealth. This was especially true during the period of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. David Ramsay is still employed as a shopkeeper in London. His apprentices are Vincent and Vin Vin; Jenkin also serves as an apprentice for Archery. A young man named Frank Touchette comes into the shop and tries to help Vincent by offering him some handkerchiefs , but Vincent refuses to sell any of them at all. In the meantime, Gardiner-Jenkin receives a mysterious visit from a wealthy ship-cheerter named John Christie whom he describes as ""a kind gentleman"" . At the end of Chapter Two, Gardiners-Henrietta discovers that her master, Sir Matthew Stewart, has been murdered. Olifaunt is staying at the Christie's, a boardinghouse owned by John Christie. His wife and children are all well-bred and clean, with plenty of room for both young men and old ladies. The only problem is that he doesn't seem to have much in common with his fellow passengers. He also has a serious case of hangover from drinking too much , which makes him wonder about how he'll ever make it back to England. Then there's this one guy named Richie . It turns out that Richie was involved in some sort of legal battle between the King of Scotland and the Earl of Northumberland when he tried to intervene on behalf of his father. This is where things get a little bit weird. You know, like ""The Proclamation"" or something. But hey, what can you do but wait until someone else shows up? The goldsmith tells Heriot that he intends to pay him back the money he owes him for certain items, such as a mule. He then proceeds to go into the shop of Gulliver Christie where she is selling her husband's wares. At this point, the time-meter comes out and announces that it has reached an all time high of 1,100 pounds. This seems like a lot of money at the moment, but hey, who needs cash when you can always count on your fellow citizens to help you make payments? It turns out that George Wearwell had been hired by King James V six months earlier so he was eager to show off his new mule in front of the royal procession. The journey continues through the court life of James V until finally we get to the Kings residence, Whitehall. There, there are servants, musicians, artists, and merchants--all of whom seem to be influenced by their masters. They also serve as chaperones for various noblemen whose fortunes they have depended upon. In fact, one of those noblemen is Lord Nesbitt, currently serving as King James VI's whipping boy. His name is George Heriots, after which he becomes known as ""Heriot."" At the end of the chapter, we find out that Lady Crabbe is now married to George Villiers. She has a son named Buckingham, and they have a daughter named Ursula who also happens to be very fond of her father. The narrator then tells us about Dame Donnithorne's shady business dealings with Mr. Brownlow . We also learn that she works as a seamstress for a local barber . It turns out that Dr. Barlow is in love with Little Em'ly--or maybe not so much at all. In Chapter VII, Linda becomes embroiled in a long-winded plot involving prostitution, gambling, and other illegal activities. One such scheme involves an old Scottish barber whose wife recently died. Her name is Miss Jessel, after all. You can imagine how upset Linda would be if she heard this news. Dame Ursula tells Margaret that she knows more about Frank's business dealings than she can tell. She also informs Margaret that a Scottish noble has been living in her father's house. The two of them discuss Frank, who is the heir apparent to the throne of Scotland. They then go off to see the King at court. On his way there, they stop by the palace and have a private chat with the King. He asks if he can borrow some money to help him get back on track with his legal affairs. When he says yes, Lady Ellenotts objections are met with disapproval. However, when the King gets back to London, he promises to make up for it. Nigel is introduced to the other members of the family, including Lord Glenvoyoch and his dauphin. They discuss the merits of returning to Scotland with their father, where they will be able to make a good living as a courtier. The young lord says that he would like to live in London for a short while so that he can devote more time to his studies there. He also mentions how much money he plans to make from this trip. When asked if he has any ideas about returning to England, he replies that he does not have the means. However, when asked whether he thinks it would be a good idea to go back to France, he states that he knows very little about French customs except that he lives in Paris. Then he goes on to list all the noblemen who are eligible to serve in the English House of Lords. In Chapter XII, the chapter ends with the arrival of Lord Senior, an old servant at the Beaujouche inn. This inn is described as a highly regarded institution by many scholars; however, its patrons are none other than Mr. Stewart, the baron's nephew. The feast is announced, and all the guests are seated at a board. The Chevaliers and their attendants begin to prepare for the feast, and as they are about to place the dinner on it, an indignant young man named Alan Viggory appears. He complains that he has no memory of his late friend Lord Glenvinoch. Dalgono tries to cheer him up by pointing out how much better food and drink these two gentlemen will have when they meet again in London later that evening. They leave the table and make their way back to the dining hall where they sit down to eat. On the way, they run into one of Robin Hood's henchmen, whom they invite to join them for a game of cricket. In order to counteract this bad influence, Robin Hood asks Dinah if she would like to play cards with him. Dinah says no, but Dinah does want to play card games with her husband. She also wants to be able to get some money from the Duke so that she can marry him. At the end of each chapter, Dinah gives up hope of ever meeting Buckingham. Lord Nigel tells the story of his travels to London. He says that he will stop any such man who tries to harm him, as long as he can repair his beard. The Lord asks about Richie's financial situation, and when Richie replies that he does not know how much money he has, he leaves the room. Glenvinoch is upset at this news, but decides to give it a try. In the park, there is a group of people mingling with horses and carts; they are all talking about gambling or crapshootery. They also have a conversation in which one of them accuses the other of having an interest in gambling. This makes Lord Glenvinzo want to go back to court, so he goes off to find a place to stay. The Templar, now in his thirties, asks for a meal and lodging at the Inn. He is not allowed to eat or drink there, but he does take food and drink from the inn's tapestry. The chapter ends with the Templar explaining that he has come to visit the Wolseys because they are interested in learning more about Alsatias. They also explain that they do not want to be associated with any particular religion; they only want to help people who are oppressed by their own society. In other words, they don't want to associate with anyone who is oppressed by them. So they invite him over to their lodgings. At first, he refuses, but eventually he agrees to accompany them. When they get there, they find out that the Wolsey sisters have been forced into exile due to the banishment of an alsatian priest named Duke Hilda-Guldebroge. It turns out that this priest is actually called ""Duke Grahames"" after the name of the local abbess . This makes everyone uncomfortable. This chapter introduces the mystery of Lady Hermione and her relationship with George. Some believe that she is planning to become his mistress, while others claim that he is preparing for a marriage. The narrator also tells us that there is one other character who could easily have been added to the cast: Margaret Ramsay's daughter MonnaPaula. Margaret is fifteen years old when the novel opens, and has just arrived in England from Spain. She is now engaged to a wealthy merchant named Lord Dalgararno. He was once married to a Scottish noblewoman, but separated from her shortly after their marriage due to an unfortunate family feud. Since then, they have had little or no contact with each other. They are both aware of the difficulties facing them as they travel through Europe. In Chapter XXVI, Lady Hermione apologizes for the delay in telling Margaret and her companion that she did not make it to Saint Jean-Luz. In Chapter XXVII, Professor Jenkin is reunited with his old friend Dr. Ursula who has just had a letter from the Templar stating that he cannot come to visit them in Alsace because of his ill health. The Templar also states that he will be returning to London as soon as possible. Meanwhile, at home, Detective Jenkin tries to convince Dame Ursulas that there must be some way to get him back on track. He tells her that if she does not help him then he will have to resign the court for life or else he will lose all his money and reputation. At this point, Father Donnithorne comes out of his hiding place and asks permission to speak to Madame Ursula so that he may ask her about the matter. She grants him permission but refuses to allow him to do so. Nigel leaves the apartment and returns to his room, where he finds a letter waiting for him. It is addressed to Lowestefere, who has requested that Nelly be allowed to stay with him as long as she needs it. He asks if there is anything he can do to help him in return for Nelly's help. The note also states that they will have to pay a certain amount of money so that when Nelly gets back to England, no one will suspect her of any wrongdoing. After Nelly departs, Duke Halvorsen arrives at the apartment looking for someone to take the letter to. He gives it to Nelly but refuses to let her use it. She does not want to hear about what happened to her father. She goes on to say that she would like to know how her kindred are going to receive their new bride. They all leave together. The charwoman leaves the room and returns later with a book for her to read. She is not able to find any other books, so she goes back to sleep. The next morning, Linda wakes up in the middle of night only to discover that someone has murdered her father. It turns out that the culprit is Lancelot Rigdon, who was supposed to have killed his father when he went hunting on Monday. They are all very upset about what they've just witnessed. Linda tells them to go get help from a local doctor or some other respectable person because she's going to need assistance getting justice for her dad's murder. Yep, that's it for Chapter XXVI. The boat pulls up to the dock, and when it reaches the owner's house, they put Martha in a room with her. Martha is worried about what to do now that she has brought along all this wealth. The ship chandelier starts spewing nonsense from the mouth of the Hudson River, as does the snarling voice of the pirate-chieftain, John Christie. It turns out that John Christie owns the country estate where Martha lives. As soon as Martha leaves the shop, a drunken sailor hurries into the scene. He throws down a shovel and picks up a letter addressed to Martha. Martha tries to stop him, but he tells her not to worry--he will take care of her if she should need anything. Martha then runs off to find a Scottish barber who will be able to help her escape. Meanwhile, Lord Senior joins them on their way to the royal court. They are greeted warmly by the King, who thanks them profusely for their assistance. The Prince and his men rush to the King's aid. The King tells them that he has been shot in the arm by a man named Nigel Oliefaunt, who they believe is also an accomplice to the crime. They then go to search for the missing king. When they find him, they question him about where he is and if he will confess. He says that he does not want to confess because he is here accused of seducing a young woman. Glenvinearloch tries to convince him that it is all a misunderstanding between himself and Lady Nelly. But when he hears this, he becomes very angry and wants to know why she is there. Lord Glenevarloch finally persuades him to reveal his identity. This chapter introduces the events of the previous chapters. The main thrust of the story concerns the kidnapping of a young noblewoman, Lady Nelly Davy-Ramsay. Heriot claims that she has been kidnapped and is being held captive by her captor, Mr. Malagrother. She has escaped capture on charges of treason and conspiracy to defraud the King. Glenvarbarloch states that he will take action against her if she should be found guilty or sentenced to death. In this chapter, we also learn that the King's warrant for her arrest has mysteriously disappeared. This makes sense because it means that no one can accuse anyone of wrongdoing until they present themselves before him. Richie pays a visit to King James, where he learns that the jewels belonging to Lady Hermione have been stolen. The jeweler shows him the diamonds and tells him that they will be returned if he agrees to repossess them. The King of Scotland is outraged at this news, but decides to take action on it himself. He banishes all members of the royal court except for his loyal earl-turned-lawyer, George Herbert. In Chapter XXXII, the King gives up his position as Duke of York and takes refuge in the palace chapel. His father enters with the news that Lady Hermione has agreed to give birth to Prince Charles' daughter, Rodolphe. She now lives in Spain with her uncle, who died when she was pregnant. Her parents are both very strict about keeping track of their children's health. The King and his men interrogate the boy, who reveals to them that she is a prostitute. They then question him about his relationship with Lady Hermione, but discover that he has no real interest in her. The King also informs them that Glenvarno will soon be leaving for Scotland, presumably on business terms. In order to clear up any misunderstandings, the King asks if anyone still serves as his captain. When asked, the Boy responds that he does not; however, when asked, he replies that he would rather serve as a robber than as a pikeman. This makes the King even more furious. He threatens to take revenge if they fail to do so. A stranger arrives at the scene and inquires about the identity of the thief. The stranger says that he knows where Richie is and offers to escort him to an estate outside of Glasgow. At this point, it becomes clear that the man is none other than Richie . The stranger tells Richie that he plans to go north to find a place called Camlet moat , which is conveniently located near the Devil's Inn. Dalgarnos and Nelly make their way to the wedding feast, but before they can get there, a shot is fired in the air. The men are attacked by three attackers, who flee into the woods. They arrive at the wedding party just as the shots are being fired. As they wait for someone to come, DALGAROS shoots one of his men in the arm. He dies instantly from the wound he received during the shooting. Lowestoft manages to escape with the help of Jin Vin , who has hidden behind a tree. In the aftermath of the shooting, Lady Dalgono learns that her husband has been murdered. She also learns that Glenvanoch's wife has fled to America with the money she left behind on the night of the robbery. Meanwhile, Lady Macbeth is married to David, whom she dislikes very much. George Heriot His father was a successful businessman and politician who enjoyed the support of the people of Edinburgh. He also had a charitable organization, which endeavored to give back to the people in Scotland through his philanthropy. George's first wife was an extremely wealthy woman whose husband died when she was only twenty-1st year old. After her death, George assumed the position of jeweller for Queen Elizabeth I until 1624. The chapter ends with a description of George's appearance as follows: ""his fair hair  favored the gentleman; his lower half was very corpulent."" George's second wife was Anne Turner, a wealthy landowner who married a baronet named John Ramsay. They had two children together. In 1612 they lost their first child. George then went on to work as a Jeweller for King James II. This book is full of satirical references to Scottish history. Note: Some editions of this book do not include any additional information about George's character. Note : Some editions do not contain all the information that the previous edition did.

The Answer," After the destruction of the Yeerk pool, Jake, Tobias, and Marco witness the Yeerks destroying the last remnants of their hometown and watch as the Pool ship lands amidst the destruction. After briefly considering destroying the Pool ship, the Animorphs decide that capturing the vessel would be a better strategy. Hoping to gain military assistance for the attack, Jake visits Major General Sam Doubleday. Although Doubleday is initially distrustful of Jake, he eventually listens and agrees to Jake's plan after a Controller-major on the general's staff tries to kill Jake. After a Yeerk attack on the general's base, Doubleday evacuates his troops and confines them and himself for three days to eliminate any remaining Controllers amongst his soldiers. Unfortunately, the confinement of Doubleday and his troops means a three-day delay before the Animorphs can launch their attack on the Pool ship. Sensing that the Yeerks could get the new Yeerk pool that is under construction operational within that time period, the Animorphs decide to take out the Taxxons digging the pool. In the ensuing battle, Jake finds himself underground and in the company of several Taxxons, led by none other than Arbron, a former companion of Eflangor's who became a Taxxon-nothlit several years earlier. Arbron makes Jake an offer: in exchange for allowing his followers to become nothlits and make a home for themselves on Earth, the 1709 non-Controller Taxxons on the surface and on board the Pool ship will defect and join the Animorphs in their fight against the Yeerks. Jake returns to the Hork-Bajir valley and tells the others of Arbron's offer. The brief period of excitement that reigns through the camp is spoiled, however, when Ax tells the others that the Andalites have decided that the war for Earth is lost and are planning on destroying humanity in order to stop the Yeerk menace once and for all. Ax insists that the only way to stop this is to capture the Pool ship and use its communications technology to contact the Andalite people directly, whom he does not expect to support his government's sterilization plan. The Animorphs return to Arbron and his Taxxon followers and secure their support. Jake promises the Taxxons a safe haven on Earth and the opportunity to morph anacondas. Immediately afterwords, Tom arrives and offers to assist the Animorphs in capturing the Pool ship, in exchange for the Blade ship, a hundred of his own morph-capable followers, and safe passage out of the Solar System. Sensing a trap, Jake accepts Tom's offer while simultaneously setting his own plan into motion. Jake dispatches Marco to locate Erek King and bring him to the Hork-Bajir valley, while Cassie and Ax are sent to capture Chapman. Jake manipulates Erek's pacifist programming by threatening to kill Chapman if Erek does not actively participate in the assault on the Pool ship. Erek grudgingly agrees to help. With the attack set to begin, Jake meets up with Tom and the original Animorphs, including a severely beaten Cassie, and proceeds to board the Pool ship. Once on board, Tom, as expected, betrays Jake by having a Taxxon eat Cassie and the other Animorphs, whom he believes to be hiding on Cassie in morph. Unknown to Tom, ""Cassie"" is actually a holographic projection by Erek, and the Taxxon is Tobias in morph, escorted by free Hork-Bajir led by Toby Hamee. After devouring the hologram, Tobias and Erek, with the other Animorphs in tow, are led off the bridge by Toby so they can begin trying to gain control of the Pool ship's computer systems. Visser One gives Tom command of the Blade ship so he can wipe out the Taxxon resistance. Unbeknownst to the Yeerks and the Animorphs (save for Jake), Rachel is hiding as a flea on Tom's head, with orders to kill him and prevent the Blade ship from escaping with the morphing cube, an assignment that Rachel is not expected to survive. The auxiliary Animorphs and General Doubleday's forces begin their attack on the Pool ship. Visser One lifts the ship off the ground and uses its massive weapons array to kill the auxiliary Animorphs and several of Doubleday's troops. Jake, who is still on the bridge, is forced to watch the massacre until Ax and Erek are able to gain control of the helm and force the Pool ship out of firing range. This act makes Visser One realize that the Animorphs have infiltrated the Pool ship's engineering section and orders his troops to kill everyone in the room. Jake meets up with the others, who escaped the engine room before Visser One's forces could carry out their orders, and tells them of Rachel's part in his plan. The Animorphs continue with their assault and make their way to the Pool ship's on-board Yeerk pool. Hoping to distract Visser One and Tom long enough to save Rachel's life, Jake orders Ax to flush the pool, killing 17,372 unhosted Yeerks. The Animorphs continue to the bridge, where they find a defeated and battle-weary Visser One. Jake asks the visser to fire on the Blade ship with the hope that the shots will disable it, but the Dracon beams miss and Erek drains the remaining power from the weapons. Tom hails the Pool ship to gloat about his victory, and sees Jake in tiger-morph. Enraged at the realization that the Animorphs survived his trap, Tom orders the Blade ship's weapons to be targeted at the Pool ship's bridge. Jake orders Rachel to attack... *The Animorphs make an alliance with a group of Taxxons led by Arbron. *Jake proposes to Cassie, but she opts to wait until a year after the war ends. *The auxiliary Animorphs are killed. *Rachel is sent to the Blade ship, while the rest of the original Animorphs begin their assault on the Pool ship. Marco initially tells Jake that Doubleday, a three-star general, which in the United States Army is a Lieutenant General. However, Doubleday himself later says that he is a Major General, which is a two-star rank.

The White People," A discussion between two men on the nature of evil leads one of them to reveal a mysterious Green Book he possesses. It is a young girl's diary, in which she describes in ingenuous yet evocative prose her strange impressions of the countryside in which she lives, as well as conversations with her nurse, who initiates her into a secret world of folklore and ritual magic. Throughout, she makes cryptic allusions to such topics as ""nymphs"", ""Dôls"", ""voolas,"" ""white, green, and scarlet ceremonies"", ""Aklo letters"", the ""Xu"" and ""Chian"" languages, ""Mao games"", and a game called ""Troy Town"" (the last of which is a reference to actual practices involving labyrinths or labyrinthine dances). The girl's tale gradually develops a mounting atmosphere of suspense, with suggestions of witchcraft, only to break off abruptly just at the point where a supreme revelation seems imminent. In a return to the frame story, the custodian of the diary reveals that the girl had ""poisoned herself—in time"", making the analogy of a child finding the key to a locked medicine cabinet.

"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave"," Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass encompasses eleven chapters that recount Douglass' life as a slave and his ambition to become a free man. The story begins by telling the reader that Douglass does not know the date of his birth and that he is relatively saddened by this. He continues by explaining that his mother died when he was 7 years old. This does not affect Douglass outwardly because he was intentionally separated from his mother when he was very young, a practice which was common in slavery. It was only on the rare occasion that he would see his mother at nighttime. His father was believed to be a white man, and most people actually had the notion that Douglass was the son of his owner. At a very early age, Douglass witnesses his first brutal act of slavery when he sees Aunt Hester being whipped. The text continues and details the structure of farms, what role slaves play, and how they operate when interacting with their masters. A very important section of the Narrative is found at this point, where Douglass describes the singing of the slaves. After this, Douglass details the cruel interaction that occurs between slaves and slave holders, as well as how slaves are supposed to behave in the presence of their masters, and that even when Douglass says that fear is what kept many slaves where they were, when they tell the truth they are punished by their owners. Douglass continues by describing several events in which there has been extreme brutality against his fellow slaves. At this point in the Narrative, Douglass is moved to Baltimore, Maryland. This is rather important for him because he believes that if he had not been moved, he would have remained a slave his entire life. He even starts to have hope for a better life in the future. At this point, he discusses his new mistress, Mrs. Sophia Auld, who begins as a very kind woman but eventually turns cruel. Douglass learns the alphabet and how to spell small words from this woman, but her husband, Mr. Auld, disapproves, and states that if slaves could read, they will not be fit to be a slave, being unmanageable and sad. Upon hearing why Mr. Auld disapproves of slaves being taught how to read, Douglass realizes the importance of reading and the possibilities that this skill could help him. He takes it upon himself to learn how to read and learn all he can, but at times, this newfound skill torments him. Douglass then gains an understanding of the word abolition and develops the idea to run away to the North. He also learns how to write and how to read well. At the age of ten or eleven, Douglass' master dies and his property is left to be divided between his son and daughter. The slaves are valued alongside with the livestock, causing Douglass to develop a new hatred to slavery. He feels lucky when he is sent back to Baltimore to live with the family of Master Hugh. He is then moved through a few before he is sent to St. Michael's. He regrets not having attempted to run away, but on his voyage he makes a mental note that he traveled in the North-Easterly direction and considers this information to be of extreme importance. For some time, he lives with Master Thomas Auld who is particularly cruel, even after attending a Methodist camp. He is pleased when he eventually is lent to Mr. Covey for a year, simply because he would be fed. While under the control of Mr. Covey, Douglass is a field hand and has an especially hard time at the tasks required of him. He is harshly whipped almost on a weekly basis, apparently due to his awkwardness. He is worked and beaten to exhaustion, which finally causes him to collapse one day while working in the fields. Because of this, he is brutally beaten once more by Covey, and eventually complains to Thomas Auld, who ultimately sends him back to Covey. One day, Covey attempts to tie up Douglass, but he fights back. After a long, two hour physical battle, Douglass ultimately conquers. After this fight, he is never beaten again. He is sent to live on another plantation where he befriends other slaves and teaches them how to read. He and the others make a plan to escape, but before doing so, they are caught and Douglass is put in jail. After he is released 2 years later, he is sent to Baltimore once more, but this time to learn a trade. He becomes an apprentice in a shipyard where he is abused by several white people, when 4 whites nearly takes off his left eye. When this happens, Douglass goes to Master Hugh, who is kind regarding this situation and refuses to let Douglass return to the shipyard. Master Hugh tries to find a lawyer, but all refuse, saying they can only do something to a white person. Sophia Auld, who had turned cruel, had pitied Douglass and tended to the wound at his left eye until he is healed. At this point, Douglass is employed to be a caulker and receives wages, but is forced to give every cent to Master Auld in due time. Douglass eventually finds his own job and plans the date in which he will escape to the North. He succeeds, but Douglass does not give details of how he did so, in order to protect those who helped him and to ensure the possibility of other slaves' escape. At this point, Douglass unites with his fiancé and begins working as his own master. He ultimately attends an antislavery convention and supports the cause from that time forth.

The Valley," Those living in the insular Nant Valley believe they are immune to the changes going on in the outside world. However, outsiders have discovered the rural idyll and are moving in to enjoy its benefits. Dafydd, the ubiquitous postman, is uncertain the Valley is ready for newcomers. The mysterious Stefan buys a derelict manor house and tries to become a squire - but finds his money impresses no-one and can't even get a drink in the pub as Gwillim the landlord hates all customers. Jane and Rob, artistic but impoverished urbanites, want to live The Good Life, but their passion for alfresco nudity has tragic repercussions for the farming community.

","The Valley The narrator explains that the narrator and Mary are aboard a ship headed for Earth. They're greeted by President Davis, who is overjoyed to have made it there. He tells them that he's told the truth about what happened in space--that they can now live on Earth without having to deal with ""the force walls"" or ""the unending stream of biological disasters"" . Uh-oh. Back at the lab, the narrator describes the aftermath of the launch: ""We were both watching the waves of time as they moved through the galaxy toward an uninhabited world. And looking at all those lifeless bodies floating in the ocean was like staring at white stones."" This is where the narrator gets his name wrong. It turns out that Dr. Manette has been working on this very same project for several years; she's finally convinced him to go ahead and create a new kind of life here on Earth instead of going back to space. In other words, he wants to make himself useful again. But first, he needs to find another way to help people get back to their old ways. Finally, though, he decides to head off to Earth anyway.",0.9663890457432494,0.15999999526912015
The Jolly Corner," Spencer Brydon returns to New York City after more than thirty years abroad. He has agreed to have his old family house demolished in favor of a more lucrative apartment building. Before the wreckers begin, he starts to prowl the house at night. Brydon has begun to realize that he might have been an astute businessman if he hadn't forsaken moneymaking for a more leisurely life. He discusses this possibility with Alice Staverton, his woman friend who has always lived in New York.

She had come to the house because she sensed he was in danger. She tells him that she pities the ghost of his alter ego, who has suffered and lost two fingers from his right hand. But she also embraces and accepts Brydon as he is.

La Maternelle," Rose, a young Parisian woman with full academic training is on the eve of marrying. Suddenly her father fails; she loses her dowry, and her fiance disappears. She tries to get work, but soon finds out that her diplomas are more of a hindrance than a help. They inspire only diffidence in administrative circles. Officials always declare her too good for the position. Starvation threatens, and finally she sets to work deliberately trying to appear unintelligent and rude enough to be hired. Thus she succeeds in securing a position as ""femme de service"" in the ""Maternelle"" of the working-class quarter of Menilmontant. A ""Maternelle"" is a district school for children from two to six years, preparatory to the Primary school. To ease her transition to this new environment and ward off thoughts of despair she decides to keep a diary of her daily experiences. This diary shows her to be an extremely kind-hearted woman and at the same time a keen observer. Rose has the lowest tasks in the school: she dusts, sweeps the rooms, lights the fire early in the morning, and she takes care of the children physically, all day round. Although the directress and the two subordinate teachers are her superiors, Rose is the one that comes in closest contact with the children. Rose is the one to whom they go to naturally all the time, as they would to a mother; she washes them when their nose is bleeding, in her arms they find consolation when roughly handled by a schoolmate; in her skirt they hide to find protection against angry and threatening parents. The pupils belong to the working poor, and many of them are so neglected and so miserable in their homes that the school is a better place for them to be. And the school to them is Rose. The children include ""mouse,"" the gentle five-year-old little mother with her brother, her ""chickling;"" Richard, who cannot imagine that there might exist anything like disinterested kindness and he conceives of every relation between two human beings as a bargain; Adam, the strong and noisy leader of the older boys and a great boaster, the girls who admire him because they are afraid of him. The cat Mistigris, who eats little birds and thereby stirs up the wrath of the children.

Orlando Furioso," The action of Orlando Furioso takes place against the background of the war between the Christian emperor Charlemagne and the Saracen King of Africa, Agramante, who has invaded Europe to avenge the death of his father Traiano. Agramante and his allies – who include Marsilio, the King of Spain, and the boastful warrior Rodomonte – besiege Charlemagne in Paris. Meanwhile Orlando, Charlemagne's most famous paladin, has been tempted to forget his duty to protect the emperor through his love for the pagan princess Angelica. At the beginning of the poem, Angelica escapes from the castle of the Bavarian Duke Namo, and Orlando sets off in pursuit. The two meet with various adventures until Angelica saves a wounded Saracen knight, Medoro, falls in love, and elopes with him to Cathay. When Orlando learns the truth, he goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa destroying everything in his path. The English knight Astolfo journeys to Ethiopia on the hippogriff to find a cure for Orlando's madness. He flies up to the moon (in Elijah's flaming chariot no less) where everything lost on earth is to be found, including Orlando's wits. He brings them back in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them, thus restoring him to sanity. (At the same time Orlando falls out of love with Angelica, as the author explains that love is itself a form of insanity.) Orlando joins with Brandimart and Oliver to fight Agramante, Sobrino and Gradasso on the island of Lampedusa. There Orlando kills King Agramante. Another important plotline involves the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero. They too have to endure many vicissitudes. Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress Alcina and has to be freed from her magic island. He also has to avoid the enchantments of his foster father, the wizard Atlante, who does not want him to fight. Finally, Ruggiero converts to Christianity and marries Bradamante. Rodomonte appears at the wedding feast and accuses him of being a traitor to the Saracen cause, and the poem ends with Ruggiero slaying Rodomonte in single combat. Ruggiero and Bradamante are the ancestors of the House of Este, Ariosto's patrons, whose genealogy he gives at length in canto 3 of the poem. The epic contains many other characters, including Orlando's cousin, the paladin Rinaldo, who is also in love with Angelica; the thief Brunello; and the tragic heroine Isabella.

Where Angels Fear to Tread," On a journey to Tuscany with her young friend and traveling companion Caroline Abbott, widowed Lilia Herriton falls in love with both Italy and Gino, a handsome Italian much younger than herself, and decides to stay. Furious, her dead husband's family send Lilia's brother-in-law Philip to Italy to prevent a misalliance, but he arrives too late. Lilia had already married the Italian and becomes pregnant again. While giving birth to her son, she dies. The Herritons send Philip again to Italy, this time to save the infant boy from an uncivilized life and to save the family's reputation. Not wanting to be outdone—or considered any less moral or concerned than Caroline for the child's welfare—Lilia's in-laws try to take the lead in traveling to Italy. In the public eye, they make it known that it is both their right and their duty to travel to Monteriano to obtain custody of the infant so that he can be raised as an Englishman. Secretly, though, they have no regard for the child; only public appearances. Similarly to A Room with a View, both Italy and its inhabitants are presented as exuding an irresistible charm, to which eventually Caroline Abbott also succumbs. However, there is a tragic ending to the novel: the accidental death of Lilia's child, which spurs a series of drastic changes within the story. Gino's physical outburst toward Philip in response to the news makes Philip realize what it is like to truly be alive. The guilt felt by Lilia's sister-in-law Harriet causes her to lose her mind. Finally, in Forster's novel, Philip realizes that he is in love with Caroline Abbott but that he can never have her, because she admits, dramatically, to being in love with Gino. The film by contrast, adds a positive ending to the story by hinting that Caroline's love for Gino may be just a passing fancy, with love between herself and Philip being possible. * Forster, E.M., Where Angels Fear to Tread, ed. by Oliver Stallybrass (London, 1975). * Winkgens, Meinhard, ’Die Funktionalisierung des Italienbildes in den Romanen ""Where Angels Fear to Tread"" von E.M.

Simon," The story begins on the eve of the English Civil War in 1642. Simon Carey is the school age son of John and Anne Carey, of Lovacott Farm, near Great Torrington in Devon. He has a sister, christened Marjory, whom he always calls ""Mouse"". One day he is the house of his best friend Amias Hannaford with whom he does his schoolwork, when Amias's father Doctor Hannaford announces that the king has raised his standard at Nottingham, and calls for a toast to the king. Simon refuses, because he and his family support Parliament. This leads to a falling out between the families. Simon's father goes off to fight for Parliament but orders Simon to finish school first. One day while Simon is getting his horse Scarlet reshoed in town, a rider falls down in front of him after being pursued and almost run over by the following horses. He and the smith rescue the young rider. Through his knowledge of the area and the introduction of the rescued man Barnaby Colbourne, a Parliament man, he manages to lead retreating Parliament troops under Colonel Ireton past a Royalist stronghold to safety. A few months later, after finishing his education, Simon goes to Windsor to join the New Model Army. He is fortunate to fall in again with Lieutenant Colebourne who recommends him to General Thomas Fairfax. Simon is commissioned as cornet to Colbourne in the Fairfax Horse. One of his subordinates is the devout Corporal, former Ironside 'Zeal-for-the-Lord' Relf. He first sees action in the decisive Battle of Naseby. After the battle Corporal Relf deserts, having learned that his neighbour has stolen all his money from him. He is recaptured and sentenced to the Pioneer regiment, one of the harshest of units, but escapes. Simon's troop heads west and is ordered to capture a house at Okeham Paine, near Exeter, which is held by the Royalists. When they break through he finds himself fighting Amias, who is with the Royalists. Simon is knocked unconscious by a musket butt and is tended by the formidable lady of the house, Mistress Killigrew. He meets and falls in love with her daughter Susanna. After his recovery he is ordered to go to Lovacott to act as a go-between for messages from Parliament spies in the area under Royalist control. One turns out to be Corporal Relf, now called Ishmael Watts, who is hiding with another spy, Podbury, in the tower of Torrington Church above the powder store. While Simon is at home, a Royalist search party led by Amias turns the house upside down, Simon's sister describes him ""not quite 'zactly"", i.e., not quite right after his head injury, and Amias chooses to believe this to stop further enquiry from his subordinates. It is then that Simon realises their friendship is still alive. When he hears the Parliament army is in Torrington, he rejoins them for the battle there. The Royalists are defeated and 200 prisoners are put in the church. When a huge explosion blows up the church, suspicion falls upon a red-headed man whom Simon recognizes as Amias, because he used a phrase they used as children. He finds him outside the town and brings his doctor father to him. Amias said it wasn't he who blew up the church. Simon is unaware he is being followed by Cornet Wainwright, who has disliked him since Simon took his coveted position as cornet. He and Amias are arrested. Amias is cleared when the dying Ishmael Watts (Corporal Relf) tells the chaplain Joshua Sprigg and General Fairfax that the explosion was an accident. The General forgives Simon, comparing his actions to those of the Biblical Jonathan who protected his friend David. The story ends four years later at Lovacott in April 1649. Simon resigned from the army at the same time as General Fairfax, because both disagreed with the decision to execute the king, although they otherwise approve of the Commonwealth. A ghost from the past, Podbury, reappears and the mystery of the blast that killed 200 Royalists seems to be solved. Simon and Amias are fast friends again and look set to marry Susanna Killigrew and 'Mouse' respectively.

Seven Little Australians," The seven children of the title live in 1880s Sydney with their father, an army Captain who has little understanding of his children, and their twenty year-old stepmother Esther who can exert little discipline on them.

The Cask of Amontillado," Montresor tells the story of the day that he took his revenge on Fortunato, a fellow nobleman, to an unspecified person who knows him very well. Angry over some unspecified insult, he plots to murder his friend during Carnival when the man is drunk, dizzy, and wearing a jester's motley. He baits Fortunato by telling him he has obtained what he believes to be a pipe (about 130 gallons, 492 litres) of a rare vintage of Amontillado. He claims he wants his friend's expert opinion on the subject. Fortunato goes with Montresor to the wine cellars of the latter's palazzo, where they wander in the catacombs. Montresor offers wine (first Medoc, then De Grave) to Fortunato. At one point, Fortunato makes an elaborate, grotesque gesture with an upraised wine bottle. When Montresor appears not to recognize the gesture, Fortunato asks, ""You are not of the masons?"" Montresor says he is, and when Fortunato, disbelieving, requests a sign, Montresor displays a trowel he had been hiding. Montresor warns Fortunato, who has a bad cough, of the damp, and suggests they go back; Fortunato insists on continuing, claiming that ""[he] shall not die of a cough."" During their walk, Montresor mentions his family coat of arms: a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot's heel, with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit (""No one insults me with impunity""). When they come to a niche, Montresor tells his victim that the Amontillado is within. Fortunato enters and, drunk and unsuspecting, does not resist as Montresor quickly chains him to the wall. Montresor then declares that, since Fortunato won't go back, he must ""positively leave [him]"". Montresor walls up the niche, entombing his friend alive. At first, Fortunato, who sobers up faster than Montresor anticipated he would, shakes the chains, trying to escape. Fortunato then screams for help, but Montresor mocks his cries, knowing nobody can hear them. Fortunato laughs weakly and tries to pretend that he is the subject of a joke and that people will be waiting for him (including the Lady Fortunato). As the murderer finishes the topmost row of stones, Fortunato wails, ""For the love of God, Montresor!"" Montresor replies, ""Yes, for the love of God!"" He listens for a reply but hears only the jester's bells ringing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a burning torch through the gap. He claims that he feels sick at heart, but dismisses this reaction as an effect of the dampness of the catacombs. In the last few sentences, Montresor reveals that in the 50 years since that night, he has never been caught, and Fortunato's body still hangs from its chains in the niche where he left it. The murderer concludes: Requiescat In Pace! (""May he rest in peace!"").
","Edgar Allan Poe begins his e-book with a description of the cask he has found in the Montreaux catacomb. He is intoxicated, and when Fortunatrice asks him to return, he says that he must first get rid of her. They go into one of the caverns where they find a chamber full of ancient Roman remains. The chamber is filled with sarcophagi, made especially for this purpose by Ferringano, an Italian wine merchant who prides himself on being able to make people feel as if they are present at the time of the crime. A short while later, Edgar discovers two staples near each other, which allow him to press down on the sides of the chamber so that it will no longer be able to see inside. This allows him to enlarge the chamber without arousing any suspicion from Fortunati. Once again, Edgar admits that he does not intend to harm Fortunate; however, he plans to do something drastic to help restore the good mood of the imprisoned man. In order to further cement the chamber, Edgar removes some of the tapestry and replaces it with a new piece of granite. Next, Edgar attempts to plaster the chamber with another set of bones--this time using a long chain attached to a small pinprick of wood. Finally, Edgar uses a torch to light up the chamber. As he finishes, Edgar realizes that there is a faint moaning sound coming from within the chamber: ""um... ugh."" It is then revealed that the chamber is actually very large . Edgar's imagination runs wild with memories of all those who have lived there for thousands of years.",0.9285608060285478,0.19313304238860554
Pandora," Pandora was born with the name Lydia in the Roman Republic in the year 15 BC to a Senatorial family. She is tall, with rippling brown hair and gold-brown eyes. Like many Patrician Roman females of the time Pandora was taught how to read and write and is well versed in epic poems, especially Ovid's works. She meets Marius for the first time when he is twenty-five and she is ten. Marius asks for Lydia's hand in marriage, but her father rejects Marius' offer. Five years later, Lydia sees Marius at a festival and begs her father to allow her to marry Marius. Her father again refuses. Pandora's father holds a high rank as a Senator. But when a new emperor takes power, her family is betrayed by her own brother and killed. Only Pandora and her traitorous brother survive the massacre, and she is taken to Antioch (after changing her name) by a man who was very close to her father. There she meets Marius again, twenty years after their last encounter. Unbeknownst to her, Marius is now a vampire. She eventually finds out what Marius has become, and also that he protects and hides the Queen and King of all Vampires. The vampire, Akabar, wants to steal the Queen's powerful and ancient blood. Marius and Pandora try to prevent him from carrying out his plan. To gain access to the Queen, Akabar uses Marius's love for Pandora against him and drains Pandora to the point of death. In order to save her, Marius is forced to make Pandora into a vampire and forced to let Akabar see the Queen, who then destroys Akabar. The pair stay together for the next two hundred years, taking care of the King and Queen of all vampires, before arguing and separating. Marius later characterized the breakup (of which he left her and she spent six months or more waiting for him to return) as being entirely his fault: He considers himself a teacher who longs to impart what he knows upon his pupils, but Pandora -being as free-spirited and highly educated as she was -had no patience to be his student. During their time together, against his objection, she did turn one of her beloved slaves into a vampire. As soon as he was turned he left the pair and was not seen again. The next time they meet again is in a Dresden ballroom in the early to late-17th century. Marius tries in vain to make Pandora leave her companion and fledgling, Arjun, and come back to him. Pandora's relationship with Arjun is of great concern to Marius, who fears Pandora is being held against her will. While she outwardly denies this, Pandora overcomes her embarrassment and admits to David in her writing that she could not bring herself to leave Arjun, citing that his stronger will propelled them both through time. The next and last time that they meet is in 1985, when she is among thirteen vampires who survived Akasha's killing spree and gathered at Maharet's house in the Sonoma compound to battle against Akasha. Pandora remains quiet and withdrawn throughout the whole ordeal, staring out the windows and saying little, rousing herself only once to say that Akasha is trying to justify deplorable ""reasons"" for a holocaust. Like many vampires, Pandora is a morose, despairing immortal who initially wanted immortality but soon regretted her choice and turns into a dark, indifferent cynic. Lestat thinks that Pandora was troubled in some deep, fundamental way even before she became a vampire, because she's the only vampire who doesn't receive visions of Maharet and Mekare in her dreams. During the confrontation in Sonoma, when Akasha directly asks Pandora to join with her or die, Pandora merely responds in a quiet, indifferent voice that she can't do what Akasha is asking of her, and stoically accepts the idea of being killed. Even after Akasha herself is destroyed and the thirteen vampires regroup in Armand's Night Island in Florida, Pandora still acts withdrawn from her fellow vampire kin, watching music videos all day long and completely ignoring Marius, who dotes on her lovingly. There is no sense of recovery or security in her as there is with the other vampires, and she departs from Night Island alone, still just as morose as ever. David Talbot encounters her in Paris shortly after the events of Memnoch the Devil and before the story of The Vampire Armand. He asks her to write the story of her life, which she does in a cafe by writing in some notebooks he gave her. She recalls the details of her life before becoming a vampire and briefly discusses the period when she was with Marius. After she has finished, she writes that she plans to go to New Orleans to look for Marius and to look into the eyes of Lestat, and try to understand what it is he saw. She is last seen at the end of Blood and Gold, alongside Marius. es:Pandora (novela) fr:Pandora (roman) hr:Pandora (vampir) it:Pandora (romanzo) pl:Pandora (powieść) pt:Pandora (livro) ru:Пандора (роман)

The Time Machine," The book's protagonist is an English scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller. The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension, and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator. In the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to 802,701 A.D., where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline, and he speculates that they are a peaceful communist society, the result of humanity conquering nature with technology, and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival. Returning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing, and eventually works out that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Within their dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutish light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing either species, they have both lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of Man at its peak. Meanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he fears he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes only when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena is presumably lost in the fire, as are the Morlocks. The Morlocks use the time machine as bait to ensnare the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth, menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out. Overwhelmed, he returns to his laboratory, arriving just three hours after he originally left. Interrupting dinner, he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange flowers Weena had put in his pocket. The original narrator takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him in final preparations for another journey. The Traveller promises to return in half an hour, but three years later, the narrator despairs of ever learning what became of him.

Dawn," 14-year-old Dawn Longchamp leads a humble, rootless existence with her parents, Ormond and Sally Jean Longchamp, and her moody older brother Jimmy, who is 16-years-old. Moving around a lot, Dawn's family does not provide much stability for her, but what her lifestyle lacks in stability, her home life makes up for in love. This erratic lifestyle seems to change when Dawn and Jimmy are able to enroll in an exclusive private school when Ormond gets a job there. It is here that Dawn's talent for singing is discovered. Her brother does not enjoy the school, feeling the weight of class differences bear down upon him. Dawn, although optimistic, does not fare much better, and is sternly ordered by the headmistress to be on her best behavior as she is of lesser social status than her classroom peers. On her first day, she also incurs the wrath of the most popular and affluent girl in the school, Clara Sue Cutler, after accidentally ratting her out on her smoking. Clara Sue then proceeds to pull mean-spirited pranks on Dawn and openly refers to her as white trash. Deeply offended, Dawn finally stops trying to like Clara Sue after this insult. However, Clara Sue's older brother, the handsome and charming Philip Cutler, does not share his sister's loathing. Phillip is kind to Dawn, and immediately shows an interest in her. He compares her beauty to that of his mother, Laura Sue Cutler, and is easily entranced. Jimmy is wary of Phillip, but does not overtly oppose Dawn's involvement with him. A shy girl who has had a sheltered upbringing, Dawn is somewhat taken aback by Phillip's immediate romantic overtures, even though she does find him attractive. Phillip urges her to date him, and after constant persuasion from him, Dawn agrees. Meanwhile, Dawn's mother, Sally Jean, has discovered that she is pregnant. This strains the Longchamps' finances, which are already tight, but Dawn is still overjoyed at the prospect of a little sibling, hoping that the baby will look more like her. Sally Jean gives birth to a little girl named Fern, but does not recover her health after the labor. She attempts several holistic ways of recovering her health but to no avail. She remains bedridden for the duration of Dawn's school year. At school, Dawn is excited by the musical opportunities now opening up to her. Her enjoyment of music culminates in her solo song, Somewhere over the Rainbow, at a school concert. Although nervous because of a prank pulled earlier by Clara Sue and her clique, Dawn draws emotional strength from the pearl necklace Sally Jean gave her earlier in the evening, which she claims are a Longchamp heirloom. Dawn's world comes crashing down after her solo performance at the school concert. Her beloved mother, Sally Jean, passes away that night. With the shock of this barely registered, what comes on the heels of Sally Jean's death truly changes Dawn's life forever. A security guard at the hospital where Sally Jean died recognizes the family, and also notices something peculiar in Dawn's appearance. He goes to the authorities, who perform an early morning raid of the Longchamp residence. Through these officers, it is revealed to Dawn that she is not Ormond and Sally Jean's biological daughter, but that she was kidnapped by them as a newborn baby, and that she is actually the daughter of Randolph and Laura Sue Cutler. Dawn is taken back to Cutler's Cove, Virginia, an offshoot of Virginia Beach. Ormond is arrested for child kidnapping. With no nearby relatives to come to their aid, Jimmy and Fern are placed in foster care. Dawn refuses to believe that Ormond kidnapped her, but the authorities prove her identity through a unique birthmark she shares with the description of the kidnapped baby. Dawn is appalled at the realization that the terrible Clara Sue is her sister; even worse, her boyfriend, Phillip, is actually her brother. These concerns fade into the background after her first meeting with Grandmother Cutler at the family's hotel, also named Cutler's Cove. Grandmother Cutler does not seem overjoyed about the return of her long-lost grandchild. She informs Dawn that she will be known by her ""true"" name, Eugenia, and that she will work in the hotel as a maid in order to prove that she is trustworthy. Dawn is shocked and upset by this cold treatment. She tries appealing to her real parents, Randolph and Laura Sue, but they are just as powerless as her. Randolph, though charming and handsome, has little willpower and prefers life to be as smooth as possible. Laura Sue is enchanted by Dawn's prettiness and resemblance to her, but refuses to make any effort to help her, as she is completely cowed by her mother-in-law. Dawn is also put at risk by Clara Sue's malicious tricks. Infuriated by Dawn's return, she does her best to make sure Dawn is fired by stealing jewellery and other items from the hotel guests. Dawn finds some comfort in the housekeeper, Mrs. Boston, who knew Sally Jean and Ormond Longchamp when they worked at the hotel. She cannot believe that her parents stole her, as they were always honest, hard-working people. Mrs. Boston hints that there is more to the ""kidnapping"" than meets the eye. Dawn's life is further brightened by a secret visit from Jimmy, aided and abetted by Phillip. Jimmy confesses that he has been in love with Dawn since they were children, but never dared show it because he felt he was sick for thinking of her that way. Dawn admits the attraction is mutual, but they find it hard to overcome their upbringing as brother and sister. This happy interlude comes to an end when Clara Sue finds Jimmy in the basement, where Dawn hid him. She tells Grandmother Cutler, who goes to the police and has Jimmy taken back to his foster parents. Dawn is heart-broken that Jimmy has to leave and is furious with Clara Sue. Jealous of her obvious affection for Jimmy, Phillip corners Dawn in her bathroom and rapes her. Desperate to get out, Dawn visits Mrs. Dalton, the woman who took care of her just after she was born, and learns that her ""kidnapping"" was staged by Grandmother Cutler because Randolph was not her biological father, as her mother had extramarital affairs, and didn't want a non-Culter child to receive benefits from the family. The Longchamps were paid with family jewels, including Dawn's pearls, to keep them quiet and to provide for Dawn and Jimmy. Outraged, Dawn confronts Grandmother Cutler about this. The old woman eventually agrees that she was the instigator and makes Dawn a deal: if Dawn will go to a singing school in New York, she will get Ormond out of prison. Dawn agrees but on one condition: that she be referred to by Dawn, not Eugenia. The book ends with Dawn going to New York.

The Return of the Native," The novel takes place entirely in the environs of Egdon Heath, and, with the exception of the epilogue, Aftercourses, covers exactly a year and a day. The narrative begins on the evening of Guy Fawkes Night as Diggory Venn drives slowly across the heath, carrying a hidden passenger in the back of his van. When darkness falls, the country folk light bonfires on the surrounding hills, emphasizing—not for the last time—the pagan spirit of the heath and its denizens. Venn is a reddleman; he travels the country marking flocks of sheep with a red mineral called ""reddle"", a dialect term for red ochre. Although his trade has stained him red from head to foot, underneath his devilish colouring he is a handsome, shrewd, well-meaning young man. His passenger is a young woman named Thomasin Yeobright, whom Venn is taking home. Earlier that day, Thomasin had planned to marry Damon Wildeve, a local innkeeper known for his fickleness; however, a minor change in disposition as regards to Wildeve delayed the marriage. Thomasin, in distress, ran after the reddleman's van and asked him to take her home. Venn himself is in love with Thomasin, and unsuccessfully wooed her a year or two before. Now, although he knows Wildeve is unworthy of her love, he is so devoted to her that he is willing to help her secure the man of her choice. At length, Venn reaches Bloom's End, the home of Thomasin's aunt, Mrs. Yeobright. She is a good woman, if somewhat proud and inflexible, and she wants the best for Thomasin. In former months she opposed her niece's choice of husband, and publicly forbade the banns; now, since Thomasin has compromised herself by leaving town with Wildeve and returning unmarried, the best outcome Mrs. Yeobright can envision is for the postponed marriage to be duly solemnized as soon as possible. She and Venn both begin working on Wildeve to make sure he keeps his promise to Thomasin. Wildeve, however, is still preoccupied with Eustacia Vye, an exotically beautiful young woman living with her grandfather in a lonely house on Egdon Heath. Eustacia is a black-haired, queenly woman who grew up in Budmouth, a fashionable seaside resort. She holds herself aloof from most of the heathfolk; they, in turn, consider her an oddity, and one or two even think she's a witch. She is nothing like Thomasin, who is sweet-natured. She loathes the heath, yet roams it constantly, carrying a spyglass and an hourglass. The previous year, she and Wildeve were lovers; however, even during the height of her passion for him, she knew she only loved him because there was no better object available. When Wildeve broke off the relationship to court Thomasin, Eustacia's interest in him briefly returned. The two meet on Guy Fawkes night, and Wildeve asks her to run off to America with him. She demurs. Eustacia drops Wildeve when Mrs. Yeobright's son Clym, a successful diamond merchant, returns from Paris to his native Egdon Heath. Although he has no plans to return to Paris or the diamond trade and is, in fact, openly planning to become a schoolmaster for the rural poor, Eustacia sees him as a way to escape the hated heath and begin a grander, richer existence in a glamorous new location. With some difficulty, she arranges to meet Clym, and the two soon fall in love. When Mrs. Yeobright objects, Clym quarrels with her; later, she quarrels with Eustacia as well. When he sees that Eustacia is lost to him, Wildeve marries Thomasin, who gives birth to a daughter the next summer. Clym and Eustacia also marry and move to a small cottage five miles away, where they enjoy a brief period of happiness. The seeds of rancour soon begin to germinate, however: Clym studies night and day to prepare for his new career as a schoolmaster while Eustacia clings to the hope that he'll give up the idea and take her abroad. Instead, he nearly blinds himself with too much reading, then further mortifies his wife by deciding to eke out a living, at least temporarily, as a furze-cutter. Eustacia, her dreams blasted, finds herself living in a hut on the heath, chained by marriage to a lowly labouring man. At this point, Wildeve reappears; he has unexpectedly inherited a large sum of money, and is now in a better position to fulfill Eustacia's hopes. He comes calling on the Yeobrights in the middle of one hot August day and, although Clym is at home, he is fast asleep on the hearth after a gruelling session of furze-cutting. While Eustacia and Wildeve are talking, Mrs. Yeobright knocks on the door; she has decided to pay a courtesy call in the hopes of healing the estrangement between herself and her son. Eustacia looks out at her and then, in some alarm, ushers her visitor out the back door. She hears Clym calling to his mother and, thinking his mother's knocking has awakened him, remains in the garden for a few moments. When Eustacia goes back inside, she finds Clym still asleep and his mother gone. Clym, she now realises, merely cried out his mother's name in his sleep. Mrs Yeobright, it turns out, saw Eustacia looking out the window at her; she also saw Clym's gear by the door, and so knew they were both at home. Now, thinking she has been deliberately barred from her son's home, she miserably begins the long, hot walk home. Later that evening, Clym, unaware of her attempted visit, heads for Bloom's End and on the way finds her crumpled beside the path, dying from an adder's bite. When she expires that night from the combined effects of snake venom and heat exhaustion, Clym's grief and remorse make him physically ill for several weeks. Eustacia, racked with guilt, dares not tell him of her role in the tragedy; when he eventually finds out from a neighbour's child about his mother's visit—and Wildeve's—he rushes home to accuse his wife of murder and adultery. Eustacia refuses to explain her actions; instead, she tells him You are no blessing, my husband and reproaches him for his cruelty. She then moves back to her grandfather's house, where she struggles with her despair while she awaits some word from Clym. Wildeve visits her again on Guy Fawkes night, and offers to help her get to Paris. Eustacia realises that if she lets Wildeve help her, she'll be obliged to become his mistress. She tells him she will send him a signal by night if she decides to accept. Clym's anger, meanwhile, has cooled and he sends Eustacia a letter the next day offering reconciliation. The letter arrives a few minutes too late; by the time her grandfather tries to give it to her, she has already signalled to Wildeve and set off through wind and rain to meet him. She walks along weeping, however, knowing she is about to break her marriage vows for a man who is unworthy of her. Wildeve readies a horse and gig and waits for Eustacia in the dark. Thomasin, guessing his plans, sends Clym to intercept him; she also, by chance, encounters Diggory Venn as she dashes across the heath herself in pursuit of her husband. Eustacia does not appear; instead, she falls or throws herself into nearby Shadwater Weir. Clym and Wildeve hear the splash and hurry to investigate. Wildeve plunges recklessly after Eustacia without bothering to remove his coat, while Clym, proceeding more cautiously, nevertheless is also soon at the mercy of the raging waters. Venn arrives in time to save Clym, but is too late for the others. When Clym revives, he accuses himself of murdering his wife and mother. In the epilogue, Venn gives up being a reddleman to become a dairy farmer. Two years later, Thomasin marries him and they settle down happily together. Clym, now a sad, solitary figure, eventually takes up preaching.

The Haunted Bookshop," The narrative begins with a young advertising man, Aubrey Gilbert, stopping by a bookstore named ""The Haunted Bookshop"" in the hopes of finding a new client. Gilbert meets the proprietor, Roger Mifflin. Gilbert does not succeed in selling advertising copy, but is intrigued by Mifflin and his conviction concerning the value books and booksellers have to the world. Additionally, Gilbert is intrigued by the fact that his firm's biggest client, Mr. Chapman, is a friend of Mifflin and has asked Mifflin to undertake the education of his daughter, Titania Chapman, by hiring her on as an assistant. Gilbert returns to the book store, meets Titania, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile mysterious things begin happening: a copy of Thomas Carlyle's Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell disappears and reappears, Gilbert is attacked as he travels home, and a pharmacist neighbor of Mifflin is observed skulking in the alley behind the bookstore at night speaking to someone in German, an assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel has posted an ad in the New York Times promising a reward for a lost copy of Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell. Gilbert starts to sense that something nefarious is afoot and suspects that the gregarious Mifflin is involved in a plot to kidnap Titania, and he assigns himself the job of protecting her. Meanwhile, Mifflin begins to train Titania in the booksellers' trade. His focus is so centered on books and their content that he fails to note the unusual things that are occurring. Gilbert takes a room across from the bookstore in order to keep eye on things, and believes his suspicions confirmed when he sees the pharmacist let himself into the bookshop with his own key late at night. Gilbert breaks into the bookshop in an effort to find evidence to prove his suspicions, but only manages to frighten and anger Titania. Gilbert learns that Mifflin is to take a day trip to Philadelphia, and follows him in the belief that the trip is a part of the ""kidnapping"" plot. In Philadelphia Gilbert confronts Mifflin with his suspicions, telling him of all the things that have occurred. The two realize that a third party had lured Mifflin away from the shop. They call the bookshop and learn that the pharmacist has left a suitcase of books there for someone else to pick up. Mifflin tells Titania to hold onto the case until he returns. Mifflin and Gilbert return to the bookshop and find it locked. Inside, the pharmacist and an associate of his have tied up Mrs. Mifflin and are menacing Titania with a gun. A fight ensues, part of the bookstore is destroyed by a bomb, and the pharmacist escapes. The only casualties of the bomb are the pharmacist's partner and Mifflin's dog, Bock. Mifflin even affects to be pleased as the blast knocked down books he'd forgotten he had. In the final chapter of the book Gilbert and Mifflin learn what the true plot was: The pharmacist was a German spy who had been using the bookshop as a drop-off point. He was a specialist in making bombs, and had hidden a bomb in one of President Woodrow Wilson's favorite books. The pharmacist's co-conspirator was the assistant chef at the Octagon Hotel. He was to be part the crew on the ship Wilson was to travel on to peace talks in Europe, and was to plant the bomb in Wilson's cabin in an assassination plot. The pharmacist was captured by police, and killed himself.

The old woman eventually agrees that she was the instigator and makes Dawn a deal: if Dawn will go to a singing school in New York, she will get Ormond out of prison. Dawn agrees but on one condition: that she be referred to by Dawn, not Eugenia. The book ends with Dawn going to New York.

Christine," In 1978, while riding home from work with his friend Dennis, nerdy teen Arnold ""Arnie"" Cunningham spots a dilapidated red and white Plymouth Fury parked in front of a house. Arnie makes Dennis stop so he can examine the car, despite Dennis's attempts to talk Arnie out of it. The car's owner, Roland D. LeBay, an elderly gentleman wearing a back supporter, sells the car—named ""Christine""—to Arnie for $250. While waiting for Arnie to finish the paperwork, Dennis sits inside Christine. He has a vision of the car and the surroundings as they were in 1958, when the car was new. Frightened, Dennis gets out of Christine, deciding he does not like Arnie's new car. Arnie brings Christine to a do-it-yourself auto repair facility run by Will Darnell, who is suspected of using the garage as a front for illicit operations. As Arnie restores the automobile he becomes withdrawn, humorless and cynical, yet more confident and self-assured. Dennis is puzzled by the changes in both his friend and Christine; the repair work proceeds haphazardly, and the more extensive repairs do not appear to be done by Arnie. Arnie's appearance improves in tandem with Christine's. When LeBay dies, Dennis meets his younger brother, George, who reveals Roland's history of violent behavior. George also reveals that LeBay's small daughter choked to death on a hamburger in the back seat of the car, and that LeBay's wife was so traumatized that she apparently committed suicide in its front seat by carbon monoxide poisoning. As time passes, Dennis observes that Arnie is taking on many of LeBay's personality traits. Dennis also notices that Arnie has become close to Darnell, even acting as a courier in Darnell's contraband smuggling operations. When Arnie is almost finished restoring Christine, an attractive girl named Leigh Cabot transfers to his high school. She is regarded as the school beauty, and her decision to go out with Arnie puzzles everyone. While on a date with Arnie, she nearly chokes to death on a hamburger and is saved only by the intervention of a hitchhiker who uses the Heimlich maneuver. Leigh notices that Christine's dashboard lights seemed to become glaring green eyes, watching her during the incident, and that Arnie tried to save her by ineffectually pounding her on the back. She realizes that she and Christine are competing for Arnie's affection, and she vows to never get into that car again. Arnie's mother refuses to let him keep Christine at home. After several arguments, Arnie's father convinces him to purchase a 30 day pass for the airport parking lot, helping to restore peace in the family. Soon afterward, Buddy Repperton, a bully who frequently targeted Arnie before being expelled from high school, and his gang of thugs vandalize the car. As Arnie pushes Christine through Darnell's garage/junkyard, the car repairs itself. Arnie strains his back in the process and begins wearing a brace all the time, as LeBay did. His relationship with Leigh declines. A number of inexplicable car-related deaths occur around town, starting with Buddy and all but one of his accomplices in the vandalism and ending with Will Darnell. The police find evidence linking Christine to the scene of each death, although none is found on the car itself. A police detective named Rudy Junkins becomes suspicious of Arnie, and his suspicions are not allayed even though Arnie is able to produce an airtight alibi for each death. It is revealed that Christine, possessed by LeBay's vengeful spirit, is committing these murders independently and repairing herself after each one. Arnie becomes obsessed with Christine, forgetting Leigh entirely, and Leigh and Dennis begin their own relationship, unearthing details of Christine's and LeBay's past. One evening, Arnie stumbles upon Leigh and Dennis intimately close in Dennis's car, sending him into a rage. Junkins also falls victim to a gruesome death. Knowing they are now at the top of LeBay and Christine's hit list, Dennis and Leigh devise a plan to destroy the car and, hopefully, save Arnie. While Arnie is out of town, they lure Christine to Darnell's garage and batter her to pieces using a septic tanker truck. The remains are put through a car crusher, and Dennis learns that Arnie and his mother were both killed in a highway accident, while Christine killed Arnie's father earlier. Witness accounts lead Dennis to believe that LeBay's spirit, tied to Arnie through Christine, tore itself away and caused the wreck. Four years later, Dennis reflects on these events. He and Leigh parted after attending college together, and he is now a junior high school teacher. He learns about a freak car accident in Los Angeles, in which a movie theater employee - possibly the last surviving member of Buddy's gang - was struck and killed by a car that smashed in through the theater wall. Dennis speculates that Christine may have rebuilt herself and set out to kill everyone who stood against her, saving him for last.

Bluebeard," At the opening of the book, the narrator, Rabo Karabekian, apologizes to the arriving guests: ""I promised you an autobiography, but something went wrong in the kitchen..."" He describes himself as a museum guard who answers questions from visitors coming to see his priceless collected art. He shares the lonely home with his live-in cook and her daughter, Celeste. One afternoon, Circe Berman wanders onto Karabekian's private beach. When he reaches out to greet her, she catches him by surprise with the forward statement ""Tell me how your parents died."" He tells her the story and proceeds to invite her back to his home for a drink. After a drink and supper, Karabekian invites her to stay with him, as Paul Slazinger does. After a time, he begins to find her charm ""manipulative"", as she typically gets her way. Mrs. Berman does not respect his abstract art collection, including works by Jackson Pollock. She explores every inch of Karabekian's home, constantly asking him questions. The only place that is off-limits to her is the potato barn. The potato barn is the home of Karabekian's studio and holds his ""secret"". The barn has no windows, and Karabekian has gone through the trouble of nailing one end shut and immobilizing the other with six padlocks. The secret of the potato barn has enticed collectors to make outrageous offers and to raise suspicions of stolen masterpieces. It is to remain locked until after Karabekian passes away.

Insectivorous Plants," All page numbers refer to where the quotes can be found in the 1875, John Murray edition. From his initial observations in 1860 of Drosera rotundifolia, the common sundew, Darwin developed a series of experiments ultimately establishing how ""excellently adapted"" these plants are to catching insects (p. 3). Darwin knew that these plants flourish in nitrogen-limited environments, growing in bogs, poor peaty soil and moss (p. 18). Most plants receive nutrients from the soil by their roots, but these plants have poor root systems and have adapted to receive nutrients (primarily nitrogenous substances) from captured insects. Darwin noted that Drosera and other carnivorous plants also feed on seeds, thus also making them vegetable feeders (p. 134). His notable observations are (p. 3–4): 1. The sensitivity of the glands to slight pressure and to minute doses of nitrogenous substances. He noted that although there is extreme sensitivity it is wholly appropriate to the purpose of gaining sustenance, e.g. they do not respond to heavy rain falling on them nor to the wind blowing other leaves against them. They have adapted well to insects alighting upon them and this saves them from wasting energy through excess movement. 2. The power to digest nitrogenous substances by secreting digestive matter and then absorbing them. He noted that digestion follows a similar pattern to animal processes (p. 135) in that acid is added to ferment the nutrient source(equivalent to pepsin). How they adapted this process from already existing substances in their system is explored later on in the book (p. 361). 3. The changes which took place within the cells when the glands are excited in various ways. A major part of the book enumerates his experiments on Drosera rotundifolia. Darwin then turns his attention to other varieties of insectivorous plants and makes comparisons, noting that in some cases different parts of the leaf are used for digestion and others for absorption of decayed matter (p. 330–331). He conjectured that plants may become adapted exclusively to one of these functions by gradually losing the other over a period of time. This would explain how Pinguicula and Utricularia came to utilise different functions even though they belong to the same family; p. 331). Darwin wrote in his autobiography that ""the fact that a plant should secrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment, closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a remarkable discovery.""

Equality," The story takes up immediately after the events of Looking Backward with the main characters from the first novel, Julian West, Doctor Leete, and his daughter Edith. West tells his nightmare of return to the 19th century to Edith, who is sympathetic. West's citizenship in the new America is recognized, and he goes to the bank to obtain his own account, or ""credit card"", from which he can draw on the annual stipend all citizens receive. He learns that Edith and her mother do not normally wear the long skirts he has seen them in (they have been wearing them so his 19th century sensibilities will not be shocked), and when Edith learns that he would not be shocked to see them dressed otherwise, immediately runs into the house and comes out dressed as a modern woman in a pants suit. Clothing varies widely, since it is made of strengthened paper, and is recycled when dirty and replaced at very small expense (shoes and dishes are made of variations on the same substance). Julian learns that women are free to compete in many of the same trades as men; the manager of the paper factory he goes to view is a woman. Edith herself is in the second year of the three year general labor period required of everyone before choosing a trade, but is on leave from that employment. The two tour a tenement house, in which no one now lives, kept as a reminder of things how used to be and a reminder not to go back to them. Julian opens his safe (a device unknown in 2000 outside museums). Dr. Leete sees his mortgages and securities not as long-obsolete claims to ownership interest in things, but rather in people and their labor. The papers are worthless except as antiquities, as most of such papers were burned at the conclusion of the economic transition, in a great blaze on the former site of the New York Stock Exchange. The gold coins in the safe are admired for their prettiness, but are also worthless. Julian learns more about the world of the year 2000. Handwriting has been virtually replaced by phonograph records, and jewelry is no longer used, since jewels are now worthless. Julian is amazed by a television-like device, called the electroscope. World communication is simplified, since everyone now speaks a universal language in addition to his native tongue. Not only are there motor cars, but also private air cars. Everyone is now vegetarian, and the thought of eating meat is looked upon with revulsion. The book concludes with an almost uninterrupted series of lectures from Dr. Leete and other characters, mostly concerning how the idyllic state West has arrived in was achieved.

Through the Looking-Glass," Alice is playing with a white kitten (whom she calls ""Snowdrop"") and a black kitten (whom she calls ""Kitty"")—the offspring of Dinah, Alice's cat in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland—when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's reflection. Climbing up on the fireplace mantel, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she is able to step through it to an alternative world. In this reflected version of her own house, she finds a book with looking-glass poetry, ""Jabberwocky"", whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up. Upon leaving the house (where it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers have the power of human speech; they perceive Alice as being a ""flower that can move about."" Elsewhere in the garden, Alice meets the Red Queen (now human-sized), who impresses Alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds—a reference to the chess rule that queens are able to move any number of vacant squares at once, in any direction, making them the most ""agile"" of the pieces. The Red Queen reveals to Alice that the entire countryside is laid out in squares like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank/row in a chess match. Alice is placed in the second rank as one of the White Queen's pawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that literally jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move. She then meets the fat twin brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, whom she knows from the famous nursery rhyme. After reciting the long poem ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"", the Tweedles draw Alice's attention to the Red King—loudly snoring away under a nearby tree—and maliciously provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she exists only as an imaginary figure in the Red King's dreams (thereby implying that she will cease to exist the instant he wakes up). Finally, the brothers begin acting out their nursery-rhyme by suiting up for battle, only to be frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them predicts. Alice next meets the White Queen, who is very absent-minded but boasts of (and demonstrates) her ability to remember future events before they have happened. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with (seemingly) nonsensical shouting about ""crabs"" and ""feathers"". (Unknown to Alice, these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing—and thus the Queen/Sheep, for a change, is speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way!) After crossing yet another brook into the sixth rank, Alice immediately encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in ""Jabberwocky"" (in the process, introducing Alice and the reader to the concept of portmanteau words) before his inevitable fall. ""All the king's horses and all the king's men"" come to Humpty Dumpty's assistance, naturally, and are accompanied by the White King along with the Lion and the Unicorn, who again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting each other. In this chapter, the March Hare and Hatter of the first book make a brief re-appearance in the guise of ""Anglo-Saxon messengers"" called ""Haigha"" and ""Hatta"" (i.e. ""Hare"" and ""Hatter""—these names are the only hint given as to their identities other than John Tenniel's illustrations). Upon leaving the Lion and Unicorn to their fight, Alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the Red Knight, who is intent on capturing the ""white pawn"" Alice until the White Knight comes to her rescue. Escorting her through the forest towards the final brook-crossing, the Knight recites a long poem of his own composition, and repeatedly falls off his horse—his clumsiness is a reference to the ""eccentric"" L-shaped movements of chess knights, and may also be interpreted as a self-deprecating joke about Lewis Carroll's own physical awkwardness and stammering in real life. Bidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice steps across the last brook and is automatically crowned a queen (the crown materialising abruptly on her head). She soon finds herself in the company of both the White and Red Queens who relentlessly confound Alice by using word play to thwart her attempts at logical discussion. They then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by the newly crowned Alice (of which Alice herself had no prior knowledge). Alice arrives and seats herself at her own party which quickly turns to a chaotic uproar (much like the ending of the first book) in which Alice finally grabs the Red Queen, believing her to be responsible for all the day's nonsense, and begins shaking her violently with all her might. (By thus ""capturing"" the Red Queen, Alice unknowingly puts the Red King—who has remained stationary throughout the book—into checkmate, and is allowed to wake up.) Alice suddenly awakes in her armchair to find herself holding the black kitten, whom she deduces to have been the Red Queen all along, with the white kitten having been the White Queen. The story ends with Alice recalling the speculation of the Tweedle brothers, that everything may have, in fact, been a dream of the Red King and that Alice might herself be no more than a figment of his imagination. One final poem is inserted by the author as a sort of epilogue which suggests that life itself is but a dream.

The Poet," The book starts with Jack McEvoy, a crime reporter for the Rocky Mountain News (""Death is my beat""), relating how the news of his brother Sean's suicide was broken to him. Sean was a homicide detective with the Denver Police, who was found dead in his car in a remote parking lot. A one-sentence suicide note was found in the car with him, and it seemed impossible that someone else could have killed him. McEvoy, though, is reluctant to accept that his brother had succumbed to depression resulting from his investigations, even though the last one was particularly brutal: Theresa Lofton, a young college student, who was found in a park in two pieces. After much investigation on his own, including retracing his brother's investigation into the Lofton case, Jack concludes that his brother's death was simply made to look like a suicide by a serial killer. By focusing on homicide detectives who committed suicide in a similar fashion and left a one-sentence note quoting the works of Edgar Allan Poe (as Sean's did), Jack finds three clear matches to his brother's death. When the FBI finally realizes that he is on to something and attempts to block him from further access, he is able to trade his knowledge of the other deaths (one of which the FBI had not uncovered) for a role with the FBI investigative team headed by Robert Backus, the son of a famous agent within the bureau who has been overshadowed by his father's legend. Assigned the duty of handling him is agent Rachel Walling, one of Backus' main proteges, and the two of them become personally involved. The FBI nicknames the serial killer ""The Poet"" due to his use of Poe's lines with the victims. As the case focuses on an Internet network of pedophiles and one in particular (William Gladden), McEvoy is taken along on the operation to arrest Gladden, who is suspicious of the set-up and kills the FBI agent trying to arrest him, Gordon Thorson (Walling's ex-husband). McEvoy ends up killing Gladden himself while being held hostage. However, Gladden's comments about his brother's death lead McEvoy to believe that Gladden was not the killer, even though the case has been officially closed. He then finds evidence that the killings had a connection to the FBI and identifies a phone call to the FBI from Thorson's room that he links to a ""boasting"" fax sent to the bureau by The Poet. Since McEvoy knew that Walling had sent Thorson on a fake errand to buy condoms during the time the fax was sent, he suspects Walling of being The Poet and of posting to the pedophile network under the name ""Eidolon"", another Poe reference. He then learns that Walling's father, a cop, had committed suicide when she was a teenager ... and had been suspected by the investigating officers of molesting Rachel over a period of time. Since pedophiles tend to have been abused as children, McEvoy becomes worried enough to tell Backus of his suspicions. Backus tells McEvoy that they'll set a trap for Walling and then takes him to a remote location—where Backus drugs McEvoy into nonresistance. He admits that he himself is both Eidolon and The Poet, because the room mistakenly billed to Thorson was actually the one in which he stayed. He admits to all of the deaths and to his setup of Gladden as the ""fall guy"" for the murders. As Backus prepares to sodomize and then kill McEvoy, Walling (who was suspicious because of messages that she had received from both men) shows up and eventually saves McEvoy's life by knocking Backus out the window and down a long hill. Later the police find a body, however it is left open if this is Backus. Meanwhile, as the facts of the case become known, Walling's judgment is called into question due to her personal relationship with McEvoy and her professional relationship with Backus. A tabloid publishes a photo of McEvoy and Walling together. However, because McEvoy suspected her, Walling ends their relationship and takes a leave to Italy. McEvoy then takes a leave from his paper to write a book about the events, although Walling explains to him that the book will forever taint the FBI because of Backus.

"The Wide, Wide World"," The Wide, Wide World is a work of sentimentalism based on the life of young Ellen Montgomery. The story begins with Ellen’s happy life being disrupted by the fact that her mother is very ill and her father must take her to Europe, requiring Ellen to leave home to live with an almost-unknown aunt. Though Ellen tries to act strong for her mother’s sake, she is devastated and can find solace in nothing. Eventually the day comes when Ellen must say goodbye to her mother and travel in the company of strangers to her aunt’s home. Unfortunately these strangers are unkind to Ellen and she tries to leave the boat on which they are traveling. An old man sees Ellen crying and tells her to trust in God. He teaches her about being a Christian, as her mother had done, and asks her if she is ready to give her heart to Jesus. After talking with the man, Ellen becomes determined to become a true Christian, which gives her strength for the rest of the journey to her aunt’s place in Thirwall. On Ellen’s first night in Thirwall, she learns that her father forgot to inform her aunt that she was coming, so a ""Mr. Van Brunt"" escorts her to her aunt's home. This aunt, Fortune Emerson, proves to be quite different from Ellen's loving mother: she treats Ellen unkindly and refuses to let her attend school. Ellen hates living with Fortune and comes to find comfort in the society of Mr. Van Brunt and other neighbors as she becomes more familiar with her new surroundings. One day, discovering that her aunt withheld a letter from Mrs. Montgomery, Ellen runs crying into the woods. There she meets Alice Humphreys, the daughter of a local minister. Alice is kind of Ellen and invites her to tea the next day, to give Ellen a chance to tell her troubles; maybe Alice would be able to help. The girls become fast friends and Alice adopts Ellen as a sister, offering to educate her and guide her spiritually, teaching her to forgive others and trust in the Lord. Alice and her brother John, who is away at school much of the time, treat Ellen like family, even inviting her to spend Christmas in the nearby town of Ventnor with them and their friends, the Marshmans. While there, Ellen meets another Ellen, Ellen Chauncey. She also gets better acquainted with John Humphreys, who comforts her many times after the other children tease her. Ellen comes to realize that if she hadn't needed to be separated from her mother, she might never have met Alice and John. About a year later, one day when Ellen visits town, she overhears from some ladies' conversation that her mother has died. Devastated, she turns to Alice and her Bible for comfort. She stays with Alice and John until Aunt Fortune becomes ill and Ellen must look after her. Eventually Aunt Fortune recovers and Ellen returns to Alice and her other friends. After Mr. Van Brunt’s mother dies, he decides to marry Aunt Fortune; soon after, Alice tells Ellen that she is very ill and will soon be ""going home"" to Heaven; Ellen is not to grieve for her but to trust in God. She also invites Ellen to take her place in the Humphreys household. Ellen immediately moves in and begins by nursing Alice through her final weeks. After Alice dies, Ellen turns to John for guidance. He takes over as her tutor, spiritual advisor, and guiding light. By the time a Humphreys relative dies in England and John must travel overseas to handle the family's business, Ellen (though sad to see him go) is a stronger person. One day Nancy visits Ellen, bringing letters she has found while cleaning Fortune's house. They are for Ellen from her mother and express the wish that Ellen go live with relatives in Scotland; after sharing the letters with Mr. Humphreys, Ellen decides she must honor her parents' wishes so the Humphreys send her to Scotland to live with the Lindsays: her grandmother and uncle Lindsay and Lady Keith. They welcome her into their home and find her delightful, but they become very possessive of her and force her to denounce her identity as an American and as a Montgomery. Mr. Lindsay even makes Ellen call him “father” and refers to her as his “own little daughter.” The Lindsays also discourage Ellen’s faith, as they don’t see religion as being important to someone Ellen’s age. Ellen finds it hard to live without her daily hours set aside for studying religion, but still tries hard to live by her faith and everything that John and Alice taught her. Ellen misses John more than anything, and during a New Year’s Eve party at the Lindsays', he shows up asking for her. The Lindsays try to keep them apart, but they are unsuccessful. During their emotional reunion John reminds Ellen to keep her faith; in a few years, when she will be able to choose where she lives, she can return to America and live with him. When Ellen introduces John to the Lindsays, they actually become fond of him. John must soon return to America, but not without promising Ellen that they will be together forever soon. In an unpublished chapter at the end of the book, Ellen returns to America as Mrs. John Humphreys.

The Moneychangers," As the novel begins, the position of CEO of one of America's largest banks, First Mercantile American (very loosely based on the Bank of America, although it is located in an unnamed Midwestern city) is about to become vacant due to the terminal illness of Ben Roselli, the incumbent chief, whose grandfather founded the bank. Two high-ranking executives groomed for the succession begin their personal combat for the position. One, Alex Vandervoort, is honest, hard-charging, and focused on growing FMA through retail banking and embracing emerging technology; the other, Roscoe Heyward, is suave, hypocritical, and skilled in boardroom politics, and favors catering more to business than to consumers. Many characters and plot lines interweave. Senior bank teller Miles Eastin is discovered to be defrauding the bank whilst casting guilt on another teller, a young single mother. He is dismissed, arrested, and convicted. In prison, his knowledge of counterfeiting brings him to the attention of a gang of credit card forgers, who give him a job on his release. As an affiliate of the forgers, he secretly reports back to the bank's Head of Security; he is discovered and tortured, to be rescued in the nick of time. As readers increasingly appreciate Vandervoort, the protagonist, they learn of his troubled personal life. His advancement in banking circles has come as his marriage is failing; his wife is confined to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Vandervoort is shown as having developed a relationship with Margot Bracken, who is depicted as a radical attorney and political activist many years his junior; her attitudes sometime conflicts with Vandervoort's role at FMA. Meanwhile, Vandervoort's antagonist, Hayward, is depicted as a devout Episcopalian who strives to maintain an air of personal integrity and morality, only to slowly sacrifice them both in his pursuit of the presidency of FMA. As these men pursue their battle for the soon-to-be-vacant position of CEO, various issues involving the banking industry, such as credit card fraud, embezzlement, inflation, subprime lending, and insider trading are discussed. First Mercantile American is eventually revealed to have a doppelganger in the form of an organized crime family. The fight for control of the bank continues under the darkening clouds of an approaching economic recession. One of the two CEO contenders is brought down for his role in making a large loan to a dishonest multinational conglomerate (loosely based on International Telephone and Telegraph) that goes into default. The ensuing scandal causes a bank run and panic among depositors, shareholders, and employees, with the perpetrator committing suicide rather than face the consequences of his actions. The other candidate assumes the position of CEO of the half-ruined bank.

The Magic of Oz," At the top of Mount Munch, lives a group of people known as the Hyups. One of their numbers, a Munchkin named Bini Aru, discovered a method of transforming people and objects by merely saying the word ""Pyrzqxgl"". After Princess Ozma decreed that no one could practice magic in Oz except for Glinda the Good Witch and the Wizard of Oz, Bini wrote down the directions for pronouncing ""Pyrzqxgl"" and hid them in his magical laboratory. When Bini and his wife are at a fair one day, their son Kiki Aru, who thirsts for adventure, finds the directions and afterwards transforms himself into a hawk and visits various countries outside the land of Oz. When he alights in the land of Ev, Kiki Aru learns that he needs money to pay for a night's lodging (versus Oz, where money is not used at all) and changes himself into a magpie to steal a gold piece from an old man. A sparrow confronts the then-human Kiki Aru with knowledge of the theft, and Kiki says that he did not know what it was like to be wicked before, he is glad that he is now. This conversation is overheard by Ruggedo, the Nome who was exiled to the Earth's surface in Tik-Tok of Oz, and he sees through Kiki Aru's power a chance to get revenge on the people of Oz. Kiki changes himself and Ruggedo into birds and they fly over the Deadly Desert into the Land of Oz. They enter Oz as animals to escape detection by Glinda and to recruit an army of conquest from the country's wild animal population. When they first appear in the Forest of Gugu in the Gillikin Country, Kiki changes himself and Ruggedo into Li-Mon-Eags (fictional creatures with the heads of lions, the bodies of monkeys, and the wings of eagles as well as having the tails of donkeys) and lies that they've seen the people of the Emerald City plan to enslave the animal inhabitants of the Forest. Ruggedo claims that they the Li-Mon-Eags will transform the animals into humans and march on the Emerald City and transform its inhabitants into animals, driving them into the forest. Ruggedo proves their power (for Kiki's the only one who knows ""Pyrzqxgl"") by having Kiki transform one of the leopard king Gugu's advisors, Loo the unicorn, into a man and back again. Gugu offers to meet with the leaders of the other animal tribes to decide on this matter of invasion. Dorothy and the Wizard arrive with the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger in the Forest of Gugu during this council of war with a request for monkeys to train in time for Ozma's upcoming birthday party. Ruggedo recognizes his old enemies and inspires Kiki to begin transforming people and animals left and right &mdash; including Ruggedo, whom Kiki turns against by transforming him into a goose, a transformation that the Nomes most fears because as a goose he might lay an egg. The Wizard, whom Kiki transformed into a fox, follows the Li-Mon-Eag with his magic bag, the transformed Kiki, deep into the forest where he begins transforming monkeys into giant human soldiers. However, Kiki makes them so big that they cannot move through the trees. The Wizard, however, heard how to correctly pronounce ""Pyrzqxgl"" and first stops Kiki and Ruggedo by transforming them into a walnut and a hickory nut. Then the Wizard resumes his rightful form and changes Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, and Gugu back to their forms, and he agrees to change the soldiers back into monkeys. The Wizard recruits several of the grateful monkeys and shrinks them down to bring back to the Emerald City and train. On arriving there, Dorothy and the Wizard are dispatched to a magic island where Cap'n Bill and Trot went to get a magic flower for Ozma's birthday. However, the island itself causes anything living that touches it to take root there, and that is how the sailor and his friend are found when Dorothy and the Wizard arrive. The Wizard uses ""Pyrzqxgl"" to change Cap'n Bill and Trot into honeybees which narrowly avoid being eaten by the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger. When they are human again, Cap'n Bill retrieves the flower by strapping a wood plank onto his good leg, walks with that and his wooden leg onto the island, and retrieves the flower. Back at the Emerald City, Ozma and her friends celebrate her birthday (though without quite the pomp and fanfare from The Road to Oz) and then decide how to deal with the evil magicians transformed into nuts. The Wizard uses ""Pyrzqxgl"" to change them back to Kiki Aru and Ruggedo and make them thirsty enough to drink the Water of Oblivion, which will make them forget all that they have ever known. The now-blank slate Kiki Aru and Ruggedo will live in the Emerald City and learn to be good and kind.

Heart of Darkness," 'Heart of Darkness' opens in first person narrative; our narrator establishes the setting aboard a sailboat, ""The Nellie, a cruising yawl,"" anchored in the Thames River near Gravesend (England). It is somewhat hazy and late in the day. Aboard are four others: the Director of Companies (the captain), the Lawyer (""the best of old fellows""), the Accountant (toying architecturally with dominoes), and Marlow (Charlie Marlow) - all share ""the bond of the sea"" but Marlow is the only one that still ""followed the sea"" - they are waiting for the tide waters to turn. Some undefined conversation is shared lazily, the sun sets; then Marlow states how their location also ""has been one of the dark places of the earth."" Marlow continues describing the trials and tribulations that must have been encountered by the first Romans who made their way to England; how mysterious and incomprehensible the place must have seemed to them. He also explains how brutal and unscrupulous these Romans must have been: ""They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force"" - After some silence, Marlow abruptly starts up again saying, in a hesitating voice, ""I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit."" Marlow introduces the events that led to his appointment to captain a river-steamboat for an ivory trading company. He describes his passage on ships to the wilderness - to the Company's station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation: ""amongst a waste of excavations"" - disorganized, machinery parts here and there, now and then explosions of demolition, weakened native black men, that have been demoralized, in chains, literally being worked to death, and strolling behind them a white Company man in a uniform carrying a rifle. Marlow remarks on these Company men: ""I've seen the devil of violence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by all the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed and drove men—men, I tell you. But as I stood on this hillside, I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly. How insidious he could be, too, I was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther."" At this station Marlow meets the Company's chief accountant, who's dressed in ""unexpected elegance"" - ""Everything else in the station was in a muddle"" - Marlow first hears of a Mr. Kurtz from the chief accountant, who explains that Kurtz is a first-class agent, and later adds: ""'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above—the Council in Europe, you know—mean him to be.'"" Marlow leaves that station with a caravan to travel on foot some two hundred miles deeper into the wilderness - to the Central Station, where his steamboat is based - the steamer he is to captain. Upon arrival at the Central Station: ""the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show."" Marlow is shocked to learn that his steamboat had been wrecked two days before his arrival. The manager explains to Marlow that they couldn't wait, and needed to take the steamboat up-river because of ""rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill."" Marlow describes that the manager ""inspired uneasiness"" - ""just uneasiness—nothing more"" - Along with the manager, Marlow describes the other Company men at this station as lazy back-biting ""pilgrims"" - fraught with envy and jealousy. All trying to better position themselves in a way to acquire a higher status within the Company, which in turn, would carry more personal profit; but sought after such goals in a meaningless ineffective lazy manner, mixed with a sense that they were all merely waiting, while trying to stay out of harm's way. After fishing his command out of the river, frustrations are met during the months spent on repairs. During this time, Marlow learns that at this station Mr. Kurtz is far from being admired, but instead, more or less, Kurtz is resented (mostly by the manager). Not only is Kurtz's position at the Inner Station a highly envied position, but sentiment seems to be that Kurtz is not deserving of it, as Kurtz only received the appointment by his connections back in Europe. Once ready and underway, the journey up-river to the Inner Station, Kurtz's station, takes two months - to the day. On board was the manager, three or four ""pilgrims"" and about twenty ""cannibals"" that were enlisted to crew the steamer. Marlow describes the brooding wilderness, in all its glory, and in all its mystery. Here and there would be a Company post where Company agents seemed imprisoned, captive by the business of ivory; now and then on shore an occasional native village would be seen, with a frenzied uproar by the natives. Marlow expresses a greater enthusiasm towards the idea of meeting Kurtz - but things become more tense as they get closer to his station. They come to rest for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station. In the morning they awake only to find that they are immersed within a thick white fog. From the river bank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a complaining clamour in savage discords: ""It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short"" - ""The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap."" Many wondered if there would be an attack. But it was not until a few hours onwards, while safe navigation was becoming increasingly difficult, that the steamboat was hit with a barrage of sticks - little arrows, everywhere - aimed at the steamboat from the wilderness on shore. The little arrows ""looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat"" - The pilgrims with their Winchesters had opened fire into the bush. The native who had been serving as helmsman, gave up steering to pick up a rifle and shoot it. Marlow grabs the wheel to avoid snags in the river. The helmsman fell at Marlow's feet clutching a shaft of a spear, which had entered his body just below the ribs. Marlow began to screech the steam whistle repeatedly; ""the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharply—then silence"" - A pilgrim in ""pink pyjamas"" arrives at the pilot-house, and is shocked to see the dying helmsman. They watch the helmsman die with an inexplicable expression on his face. Marlow forces the pilgrim in ""pink pyjamas"" to take the wheel so that he can shed his blood soaked shoes, and while flinging the pair overboard, he is hit with a rush of thoughts; thinking he would never have a chance to hear Kurtz talk, as he is most likely dead - then submits: ""Of course I was wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than enough."" Marlow makes a vague mention of a girl, whom later Kurtz will refer to as ""My Intended"" (his fiancée): ""You should have heard him say, 'My ivory.' Oh, yes, I heard him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my—' everything belonged to him."" Marlow reflects more on Kurtz: ""His mother was half-English, his father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz"" - ""I learned that, most appropriately, the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had entrusted him with the making of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it, too. I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence"" - ""There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases, unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: 'Exterminate all the brutes!' The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of 'my pamphlet' (he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career."" After reflecting more on Kurtz, Marlow states ""I can't forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I missed my late helmsman awfully"" - ""don't you see, he had done something, he had steered"" - ""and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken."" After putting on a pair of slippers, Marlow returned to the pilot-house and resumed steering. By this time the manager is there, and expresses a strong desire to turn back - right at the moment that the Inner Station comes into view. At Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the river-bank waving his arm, urging them to land. Because of his expressions, gestures, and all the colorful patches on his clothing, the man reminds Marlow of a harlequin. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The harlequin-like chap boards the steamboat. It turns out the man is Russian, and he is a mere wanderer; who just happened to wander into Kurtz's camp: ""He rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case. 'Don't you talk with Mr. Kurtz?' I said. 'You don't talk with that man—you listen to him,' he exclaimed with severe exaltation."" - ""'I tell you,' he cried, 'this man has enlarged my mind.'"" Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz could be, how the natives worshiped Kurtz, and how very ill Kurtz has been of late. The concerned harlequin-like Russian admires Mr. Kurtz for his intellect - for his insights - into love, life, and justice. The Russian seems to even admire Kurtz for his power - and his willingness to use it. Marlow suggests that Kurtz has gone mad, and the Russian ""protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn't be mad. If I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn't dare hint at such a thing."" From the steamboat, through a glass (telescope) Marlow can observe details of the station, and is surprised suddenly to see near the station house a row of posts with decapitated heads of natives mounted atop of each. Around the corner of the house the manager with the pilgrims appeared, bearing Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area then filled with natives, who appeared to be ready for battle. The Russian stated: ""'Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for'"" - On the stretcher Marlow could see Kurtz shouting. The pilgrims carried Kurtz to the steamer and laid him down in one of the little cabins. A gorgeous native woman, with a desperate aspect, walked in measured steps along the shore and stopped right next to the steamer. She raised her arms above her head - then ""turned away slowly, walked on, following the bank, and passed into the bushes."" From the steamboat's cabin Kurtz was placed in, he is heard yelling at the manager: ""'Save me!—save the ivory, you mean. Don't tell me. Save me! Why, I've had to save you. You are interrupting my plans now. Sick! Sick! Not so sick as you would like to believe.'"" The manager walks out of the cabin, and spoke with Marlow about ""unsound methods"" and Marlow puts forward the notion: ""No method at all"" - After some more words the manager gives Marlow a heavy glance, then leaves. The Russian mentions ""'matters that would affect Mr. Kurtz's reputation.'"" - Marlow replied to the Russian: ""'Mr. Kurtz's reputation is safe with me.'"" - He informed Marlow ""that it was Kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer"" - The harlequin-like Russian refers to a canoe waiting for him, and adds: ""'Ah! I'll never, never meet such a man again. You ought to have heard him recite poetry—his own, too, it was, he told me. Poetry!' He rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights. 'Oh, he enlarged my mind!' 'Good-bye,' said I. He shook hands and vanished in the night."" Later, after midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin - he has left the steamer, and has returned to shore. Marlow goes ashore and finds Kurtz in a very weak state making his way back to his station - but not so weak, as he can still call out to the natives. Marlow appreciates the serious situation he is in, and when Kurtz begins a threatening tone, Marlow interjects that his ""success in Europe is assured in any case"" - Kurtz agrees to allow Marlow to help him back to the steamer. The next day they prepare for their departure. They carried Kurtz to the pilot-house: ""there was more air there"" - The natives once again assembled on shore, and the native woman returned - they all began to shout. Marlow saw the pilgrims getting their rifles ready - so he screeched the steam whistle time after time to scatter the crowd on shore. Only the woman remained unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims opened fire. The current was swift as they headed downstream. Kurtz's health was worsening. Marlow himself is becoming increasingly ill. The steamboat broke down and repairs needed to be made. Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers with a photograph because of his dislike and mistrust of the manager. While ill, Marlow continued to make the repairs to the steamer: ""I toiled wearily in a wretched scrap-heap—unless I had the shakes too bad to stand."" He did not have much time for Kurtz: ""One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously, 'I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.' The light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur, 'Oh, nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed."" As Kurtz dies, Marlow hears him whisper, in no more than a breath: ""'The horror! The horror!'"" Marlow blew out the candle, and tries to act like nothing has happened when he joins the other pilgrims, who were all in the mess-room dining with the manager. In a short while, the ""manager's boy"" appears and announces in a scathing tone: ""'Mistah Kurtz—he dead.'"" - Next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury ""something"" in a muddy hole. ""And then they very nearly buried me"" - Marlow falls very sick, near death himself: ""I have wrestled with death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine"" - ""I was within a hair's breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped over the edge myself, I understand better"" - ""He had summed up—he had judged. 'The horror!' He was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth—the strange commingling of desire and hate"" - ""he had made that last stride, he had stepped over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up would not have been a word of careless contempt. Better his cry—much better."" Upon Marlow's return to Europe he seems embittered. The everyday life of the Europeans seem to be something a sham - like some sort of hoax. Eventually Marlow took care of the bundle of papers Kurtz had entrusted to him. To a clean-shaven man who had an official manner, Marlow gave the paper entitled 'Suppression of Savage Customs' - ""with the postscriptum torn off"" - To another, who claims to be Kurtz's cousin, Marlow gave family letters and memoranda of no importance. To a journalist he gave a Report for publication, if the journalist saw fit. Finally Marlow was left with some personal letters and the photograph of the girl's portrait - Kurtz's fiancée, his intended. At her door, even before Marlow entered her house, memories of Kurtz began to flow, along with the final words that he whispered. The girl came forward, dressed in black, and met Marlow in a drawing-room. Although it has been more than a year since Kurtz died, she was still in mourning. It was late, and the room was growing darker. The final words of Kurtz's seemed to echo in the room with the girl. Marlow envisioned them together: ""I saw her and him in the same instant of time—his death and her sorrow—I saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death."" She presses Marlow for information, ultimately asking him to repeat the final words Kurtz had spoken. Being very uncomfortable Marlow tells her that the final words that Kurtz pronounce was her name. Marlow was surprised by her reaction: ""I heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain. 'I knew it—I was sure!'... She knew. She was sure. I heard her weeping"" - ""I wonder, if I had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn't he said he wanted only justice? But I couldn't. I could not tell her. It would have been too dark—too dark altogether...."" Then Marlow and his listeners were silent; our first narrator explains: ""Nobody moved for a time. 'We have lost the first of the ebb,' said the Director suddenly. I raised my head. The offing was barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky—seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.""

Paradise Lost," The poem is separated into twelve ""books"" or sections, and the lengths of each book varies greatly (the longest being Book IX, with 1,189 lines, and the shortest Book VII, having 640). The Arguments at the head of each book were added in subsequent imprints of the first edition. Originally published in ten books, in 1674 a fully ""Revised and Augmented"" edition with a new division into twelve books was issued. This is the edition that is generally used today. The poem follows the epic tradition of starting in medias res (Latin for in the midst of things), the background story being recounted later. Milton's story has two narrative arcs: one being that of Satan (Lucifer) and the other being that of Adam and Eve. It begins after Satan and the other rebel angels have been defeated and banished to Hell, or (as it is also called in the poem), Tartarus. In Pandæmonium, Satan employs his rhetorical skill to organise his followers; he is aided by Mammon and Beelzebub. Belial and Moloch are also present. At the end of the debate, Satan volunteers to poison the newly-created Earth and God's new and most favoured creation, Mankind. He braves the dangers of the Abyss alone in a manner reminiscent of Odysseus or Aeneas. After an arduous traverse of the Chaos outside Hell, he enters God's new material World, and later the Garden of Eden. At one point in the story, the Angelic War over Heaven is recounted. Satan's rebellion follows the epic convention of large-scale warfare. The battles between the faithful angels and Satan's forces take place over three days. The final battle involves the Son of God single-handedly defeating the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishing them from Heaven. Following the purging of Heaven, God creates the World, culminating in his creation of Adam and Eve. While God gave Adam and Eve total freedom and power to rule over all creation, He gave them one explicit command: not to eat from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death. The story of Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a fundamentally different, new kind of epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented for the first time in Christian literature as having a full relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised in the form of a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another so that if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong. After eating the fruit, Adam and Eve have lustful sex, and at first, Adam is convinced that Eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial. However, they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, and after they awake, they experience guilt and shame for the first time. Realizing that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual recrimination. Eve's pleas to Adam reconcile them somewhat. Her encouragement enables Adam and Eve both to approach God, to ""bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee"", and to receive grace from God. Adam is shown a vision by the angel Michael, in which Adam witnesses everything that will happen to mankind until the Great Flood. Adam is very upset by this vision of humankind's future, and so Michael also tells him about humankind's potential redemption from original sin through Jesus Christ (whom Michael calls ""King Messiah""). Adam and Eve are cast out of Eden, and Michael says that Adam may find ""a paradise within thee, happier far"". Adam and Eve also now have a more distant relationship with God, who is omnipresent but invisible (unlike the tangible Father in the Garden of Eden).
