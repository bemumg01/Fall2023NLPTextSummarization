Text summarization is the process of distilling key information from longer texts such as scholarly articles or narrative stories. It is a difficult task due to the difference in lengths between the input text and output summary. The general approaches involve either identifying important sentences in the text to use for a summary or generating a new summary through language generation methods. In this study, we attempt to use the latter to summarize genre fiction provided by the Project Gutenberg library. We found that many current NLP models, including pre-trained transformer, are not able to properly handle and summarize narrative texts. This paper argues that more researh should be focused in this direction to improve the ability of artificial intelligence to understand human text.
